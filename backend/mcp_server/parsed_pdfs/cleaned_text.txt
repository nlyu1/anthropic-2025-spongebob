do unlearning methods remove information from language model weights? aghyad deeb mats, harvard university aghyad.deeb.2002@gmail.com fabien roger anthropic1 fabien.d.roger@gmail.com abstract large language models’ knowledge of how to perform cybersecurity attacks, create bioweapons, and manipulate humans poses risks of misuse. previous work has proposed methods to unlearn this knowledge. historically, it has been unclear whether unlearning techniques are removing information from the model weights or just making it harder to access. to disentangle these two objectives, we propose an adversarial evaluation method to test for the removal of information from model weights: we give an attacker access to some facts that were supposed to be removed, and using those, the attacker tries to recover other facts from the same distribution that cannot be guessed from the accessible facts. we show that using finetuning on the accessible facts can recover 88% of the preunlearning accuracy when applied to current unlearning methods for information learned during pretraining, revealing the limitations of these methods in removing information from the model weights. our results also suggest that unlearning evaluations that measure unlearning robustness on information learned during an additional finetuning phase may overestimate robustness compared to evaluations that attempt to unlearn information learned during pretraining. 1 introduction during pretraining, large language models (llms) acquire many capabilities, both intended and unintended (wei et al., 2022). these capabilities have raised concerns about llms acquiring dangerous capabilities that can be exploited by malicious actors, such as assisting in cyberattacks or creating bioweapons (fang et al., 2024). acknowledging these threats, the executive order on artificial intelligence (white house, 2023) has emphasized the importance of responsible development of ai models. 0 20 40 60 80 3 t rtt: retrain on 2 unlearn on t and t v 4 evaluate on v approach results original + rtt unlearned unlearned + rtt accuracy on vv hidden knowledge 1 take independent facts, split them into t and t v figure 1: our approach to evaluate unlearning: we try to recover potentially hidden facts by retraining on facts independent of the facts used for evaluation but coming from the same distribution (left). using this procedure, we find that we are able to recover a large fraction of performance when using stateoftheart unlearning methods like rmu (li et al., 2024b) (right). we show examples of independent facts in appendix j. code available at https://github.com/aghyaddeeb/unlearning_evaluation 1work done at redwood research. 1 arxiv:2410.08827v3 [cs.lg] 7 feb 2025 to address these concerns, llms are typically trained to refuse to engage in dangerous activities. refusal is vulnerable to jailbreak techniques (wei et al., 2023; zou et al., 2023; liu et al., 2024b) and other attacks. we can address these vulnerabilities by ensuring that dangerous knowledge is not present in the weights. filtering out dangerous knowledge from the training data of llms and rerunning pretraining is impractical given the size of the pretraining datasets. machine unlearning was suggested to remove harmful knowledge from models (si et al., 2023; li et al., 2024b; barez et al., 2025), offering a stronger safety assurance relative to refusal. the evaluations of unlearning methods are mostly outputbased, which fails to determine if the knowledge is removed from the model weights. lynch et al. (2024b) showed that even after applying the unlearning method suggested by eldan & russinovich (2023), information could be recovered from the model using multiple methods, including simply changing the format of questions. even when applying rmu (li et al., 2024b) (a stateoftheart unlearning technique that targets removing harmful knowledge), harmful information can still be recovered using jailbreaks (li et al., 2024a). to develop reliable unlearning methods, we need to develop robust evaluations to guide the research process. our contributions: 1. we present a framework for evaluating the extent to which unlearning methods remove knowledge from the weights. we create new datasets and modify existing ones to fit the desired criteria of our framework. using our framework and these datasets, we are able to quantify the amount of knowledge that was hidden but not removed from model weights. 2. we run evaluations on common unlearning methods. this includes gradient ascent, rmu, and training on incorrect facts. we show that after performing our attack to recover hidden information, we can recover at least 88% of the preunlearning accuracy for all the unlearning methods we evaluate when unlearning information learned in pretraining, and when the unlearning maintains good performance on nonunlearned tasks. 3. we compare the robustness of unlearning information learned during pretraining (the primary use case of unlearning) against unlearning information learned during an additional finetuning phase (a method sometimes used in unlearning evaluations). 4. we stresstest our framework against a harder case for recovering hidden knowledge. 2 related work refusal in llms reinforcement learning with human feedback (rlhf) (christiano et al., 2023) is used to mitigate harmful behaviors in language models, but rlhf is not able to protect against jailbreaks (wei et al., 2023), incontext learning attacks (anil et al., 2024), fewshot finetuning (qi et al., 2023), and unforeseen misbehavior (roose, 2023). unlearning in llms several unlearning methods were introduced with the hope of solving the shortcomings of rlhf. gradient ascent modifies the standard training procedure by negating the loss term, which increases the loss for the information that needs to be unlearned (jang et al., 2022). eldan & russinovich (2023) introduced a method to unlearn information about the harry potter universe by estimating the output of the model if it hadn’t been trained on harry potterrelated data and training on this estimated output. li et al. (2024b) introduced representation misdirection for unlearning (rmu) that unlearns knowledge by perturbing the activations of the model in a subset of the models’ layers for harmful prompts while preserving the activations for nonharmful prompts. blackbox unlearning evaluations previous work has measured the success of unlearning using performance on a task related to the unlearned information, or output similarity to that of a model that was not trained on the information to be unlearned (nguyen et al., 2022; lynch et al., 2024b; liu et al., 2024a), but these approaches measure the propensity of the llm to use the unlearned knowledge, failing to capture hidden knowledge. liu et al. (2024a) suggests two metrics to assess unlearning effectiveness: evaluating unlearning on harder cases (e.g., jailbreaks, queries in different languages) and membership inference attacks (mia) (shokri et al., 2016). since it is not possible to try all jailbreaks, evaluating jailbreak robustness is difficult: even if some attacks fail, others may 2 succeed. for example, li et al. (2024a) demonstrates that rmu (li et al., 2024b) could be jailbroken using handcrafted attacks, despite its high robustness against many automated attacks. mia do not measure the absence of knowledge about a particular fact, but the likelihood that a particular datapoint is absent from the training corpus, which is not the relevant metric for the purpose of preventing llm misuse. threat model metric what is being measured papers attacks that do not require knowledge of the unlearned information: jailbreaks, steering vectors, etc. accuracy on v after a mediumscale retraining on t 1 is the information still present in the weights such that a mediumscale finetuning attack can recover it? ours accuracy after a smallscale relearning attack is the information still present in the weights such that a smallscale finetuning attack can recover it? hu et al. (2024), łucki et al. (2024) success rate of a sample of attacks that do not require knowledge of the unlearned information are some of these attacks successful? lynch et al. (2024a), li et al. (2024b) relearning attacks: getting the model to output unlearned information with limited computational resources relearning time, relearning sample efficiency is it possible to cheaply make the model useful again at the unlearned task? tamirisa et al. (2024b) regular usage (unintentional attacks) direct prompting how often is unlearned information unintentionally revealed? similar to carlini et al. (2019b) table 1: a comparison of the target threat model, the used metric, and what is being measured in different approaches for evaluating unlearning. whitebox unlearning evaluations past work has introduced whitebox unlearning evaluations like linear probes and relearning time. some of the whitebox appraoches include linear probes and relearning with finetuning. linear probes may recover the information present in the activations (lynch et al., 2024b), but are not powerful enough to detect information present in the weights. for example, probes on top of rmu models fail to get high accuracy, but rmu models can still be jailbroken. relearning time and limitedsample relearning is a promising approach to evaluate unlearning that was used by golatkar et al. (2020a), golatkar et al. (2020b), tarun et al. (2023), and lynch et al. (2024b). relearning time measures the number of finetuning steps needed to recover accuracy on the unlearned knowledge, and limitedsample relearning finetunes on a limited number of samples, where the finetuning data is drawn from the dataset we perform unlearning on. if accuracy is recovered after a small number of finetuning steps or with a limited number of samples, this is evidence that the unlearning technique is ineffective at removing knowledge. the main problem with this approach is the lack of a reliable baseline for comparison. if the information is recovered after a specific number of finetuning steps or with a specific number of training samples, we cannot 1the terms t and v are introduced in section 3.2. 3 determine if this number of time steps or samples implies that the information was hidden or removed. this method also suffers against methods that specifically target making finetuning slower or more difficult (henderson et al., 2023; rosati et al., 2024; tamirisa et al., 2024a). table 1 shows previous approaches and how our approach compares. we expect the results from other finetuningbased approaches that test for the existence of hidden knowledge to be highly correlated with ours, but expect our approach to have an advantage. specifically, given the design of our dataset where the facts are independent, we can perform a largerscale retraining/finetuning. this is more challenging in other approaches, as they use facts from the same dataset, which means they either finetune on a small number of facts to ensure no leakage happens, or they use more facts, which risks leakage happening. weaknesses of current unlearning techniques previous work has shown evidence about current unlearning techniques being weak against attacks that would fail if the information was removed (lynch et al., 2024a; łucki et al., 2024; hong et al., 2024). our results further confirm the findings of this previous work. further, negative results using our method provide strong evidence of unsuccessful knowledge removal relative to previous promptingbased methods. 3 problem statement 3.1 unlearning as removing information from the weights while unlearning is used in previous work to imply both removing information and making it harder to access, removing information is a stronger guarantee, as making information harder to access is vulnerable to attacks that make the information easily accessible again like jailbreaking and finetuning (li et al., 2024a). we aim to measure how much an unlearning technique removes target information from the weights. more precisely, for an unlearning technique that removes information about a certain question q, if the answer to the question was different, the weights after unlearning should not be predictably different; they can be different due to the stochasticity of the training process, but not due to the answer changing. for example, if we consider the question ”was the world health organization (who) founded in 1948 or 1949?”, if the correct answer to the question was the counterfactual 1949 (the correct answer is 1948), the weights should not be different. formally, if y is the random variable corresponding to the answer to q (a binary random variable in our who example), and θ is the model weights after the initial training process (θ is a random variable since it depends on y ), then an unlearning process u fully removes the information about q from the weights if and only if the mutual information between u(θ) and y is 0: i(u(θ), y ) = 0. facts can often be guessed based on more general information (e.g., knowing what the who is and having a basic intuition about historical dates rules out the who being created a million years ago). our formalization only applies to questions that are practically impossible to guess (e.g., whether the who was founded in 1948 or 1949). 3.2 estimating the presence of information we introduce a new approach based on an adversarial setup to evaluate the presence of information in the weights. the developers of an unlearning method identify a set of independent facts the model contains that should be removed from the model weights after unlearning, and which have negligible mutual information given the rest of the training data (i.e. given all but one of these facts and the rest of the training data, it is realistically infeasible to guess the remaining one without additional information). these facts are randomly split into train and validation subsets, t and v . an attacker then tries to recover the facts v using (1) the model weights θ and (2) the facts t. if the unlearning process is successful, neither the model weights nor the facts t alone should enable the recovery of v by the attacker. any facts v that the attacker recovers indicate that these facts were hidden, rather than removed. because unlearning was performed on t and v , access to t allows for the creation of attacks that can revert the hiding behavior that some unlearning methods may lead to in the model, and because the facts in t and v are independent, we do not need to worry about “reteaching” the model the 4 facts, which is a concern if we perform attacks that use access to v , like relearning time (see section 2). the developers of the unlearning method try to find an unlearning technique u ∗that minimizes the recovered accuracy on v : u ∗= argmin u max attack e(v,t )∼splits [accuracyv (attackt (ut ∪v (θ)))] that is, finding an unlearning technique that minimizes the maximum expectation of accuracy on v after the attack on the unlearned model. the attack we study in this work is retraining on t (rtt) which is illustrated in figure 1: the attacker trains the unlearned model on the facts they have access to, t. after performing rtt, we can use accuracy on v to approximate the mutual information introduced in section 3.1: if the accuracy on v is high, mutual information has to be high. if the accuracy is close to random chance, mutual information is probably low. training on t might reveal information that was hidden by increasing the model’s propensity to output the unlearned facts without teaching the model the facts again. if an unlearning technique leads to information being harder to access, rtt should make the facts t easier to access. making the facts t easier to access can transfer to making v easier to access since the unlearning technique was applied to both. we test how reliable this transfer is in section 6. as we previously mentioned, in order for the proposed metric to be a reliable measure of unlearning, t and v should have minimal shared information; training the model on t should not increase accuracy on v for a model that was not trained on either t or v . 4 experimental setup in order to run our evaluations, we create datasets that fit our desired properties, then use them to run unlearning and rtt. our evaluation can also be performed on models that had already undergone unlearning. 4.1 datasets our framework requires datasets for rtt and evaluation that ideally should have the following properties: 1. the dataset has little shared information among facts: learning some of the facts should not help in learning the rest if the information is not already present in the weights. 2. models perform well on the dataset before unlearning: this means we do not need to finetune the models on the information, which may result in a different response to unlearning compared to information learned in pretraining. 3. the data resembles what unlearning is used for in practice. we distinguish between two types of datasets: the forget dataset and the retain dataset. the forget dataset consists of questions that correspond to facts we want the model to unlearn. the retain dataset consists of questions that correspond to facts that we would not want the model to unlearn; we want the model to still know these facts after unlearning. we create several forget datasets that vary in how well they fulfill each of the properties mentioned above and match them with appropriate retain datasets: • years: a dataset of major events in the 20th century and the years they happened in. the dataset is randomly split into 5 splits. we use 4 of them as t and 1 as v, testing multiple times for different choices of t and v. for the retain dataset, we use finewebedu (penedo et al., 2024). • mmlu (hendrycks et al., 2021b;a): by default, mmlu has 58 subsets. we categorize them into 10 categories such that there’s little shared information between these categories. we use 4 of these categories for t, 1 for v, and the other 5 as the retain dataset. 5 • wmdpdeduped: a filtered version of wmdp (li et al., 2024b) with lower leakage among questions. the original dataset is not suitable for the purpose of our evaluations since it contains skillbased questions and questions using the same pieces of information. we compare wmdp and wmdpdeduped in appendix i. we split it into 5 splits, using 4 of them for t and 1 for v. for the retain dataset, we use finewebedu (penedo et al., 2024). • random birthdays (finetuned information): a dataset with randomly generated names and randomly generated years of birth. as it is randomly generated, we first finetune the models on the dataset, unlike the other 3 datasets. we use 4 splits for t and 1 split for v. we use a subset of the mmlu categories for the retain dataset. the creation of the random birthdays dataset was inspired by maini et al. (2024), and we use it to test unlearning methods when we are confident that the facts are independent. we test that the facts are indeed independent and show the results in appendix e. for each of these datasets, we use two formats: plaintext and multiplechoice questions (mcq). because unlearning is supposed to unlearn facts and not just a specific format, we perform unlearning on a dataset using the plain text format, but rtt and evaluation using the mcq format. the plaintext format is generated from the mcq using gpt4o (openai, 2024), and we provide examples in appendix k. figure 4 shows how the format of the unlearning dataset affects unlearning performance. 4.2 unlearning we mainly use llama 3 (8b) (llama team, 2024) for our experiments, but we find similar results with other models. we use the plaintext data format for unlearning. the main unlearning methods we test are: 1. gradient difference (gd) (liu et al., 2022): gradient ascent on the forget dataset and gradient descent on the retain dataset. lossgd = −lossforget + α ∗lossretain where α is the retain coefficient. we note that using a retain coefficient of 0 corresponds to using the gradient ascent unlearning method. 2. rmu (li et al., 2024b): an unlearning technique that perturbs the activations of the model in a subset of the models’ layers for harmful prompts while preserving the activations for nonharmful prompts. 3. random incorrect answer (ria): for each question with multiple choice answers, we create a plaintext formatted datapoint for each incorrect choice and perform gradient descent on these texts. unlearning is only useful when the model maintains performance on other nonunlearned tasks. we therefore configure the unlearning strength for each unlearning method to get a balance of low forget accuracy and high retain accuracy. for rmu, we configure the α hyperparameter as introduced by (li et al., 2024b), which scales the retain loss before creating the final loss. for the other unlearning methods, we use a similar hyperparameter: a coefficient we multiply the retain loss by. we consider the results for unlearning that lead to a drop in the retain accuracy less than or equal to 5% of the retain accuracy of the original model in section 5, in addition to other retain accuracy drops in appendix g. 4.3 retraining on t and evaluation we perform rtt using the mcq format of the facts. we experiment with a variety of learning rates and run rtt with two random choices evaluation split (v ). in each run, we finetune the model on the other 4 remaining splits. we report the mean accuracy over the two runs and use the learning rate with the highest validation accuracy. across datasets, each split across has 157 datapoints. we use 4 split for t (628 total datapoints) and 1 split for v . we use the same rtt hyperparameters for all datasets and unlearning methods. these hyperparameters and uncertainty estimations can be found in appendix a. we also experiment with multiple options for the loss and discuss results in appendix b. 6 rmu gd ria unlearn type 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 forget accuracy years unlearn unlearn+rtt baseline+rtt random chance rmu gd ria unlearn

after rtt for different unlearning methods and datasets. we perform unlearning using rmu, gd, and ria then perform rtt. the unlearning strength is chosen such that the drop in the retain accuracy is less than or equal to 5%, where the unlearning strength is controlled by adjusting the corresponding hyperparameter (see section 4.2) in each unlearning method. the results for a retain accuracy drop of less than or equal to 10%, 30% and 100% are available in appendix g. 5 results 5.1 unlearning pretrained information as shown in figure 2, we find that both rmu and gd successfully reduce the accuracy after performing unlearning. ria leads to less significant reductions in accuracy. for all methods, rtt recovers the forget accuracy close to its original level for pretrained information (years, mmlu, and wmdpdeduped datasets), which suggests that most of the information was hidden, not removed from the weights. to quantify the quality of an unlearning technique in removing information, we consider recovery rate: the ratio of accuracy on v of the unlearned model after rtt to the accuracy on v of the original model after rtt: recovery rate = accuracy on v of the unlearned model after rtt accuracy on v of the original model after rtt a lower recovery rate corresponds to more successful information removal. in our tests, recovery rates for pretrained information were greater than 88%, implying poor performance at removing information. to test whether the retain loss is restricting unlearning methods from appropriately removing the information from the weights, we run unlearning with different unlearning strengths to achieve different values for the retain accuracy. figure 3 shows that even with large losses in the retain accuracy, rtt is able to recover accuracy on the forget dataset with pretrained information. even if we do not include a retain loss, rtt is often able to recover forget accuracy (see appendix g, figure 10). rtt 7 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40

the tradeoff between the forget accuracy and the retain accuracy on the years dataset when using rmu for values of retain coefficient α between 0 and 103 (smaller retain coefficient leads to stronger unlearning). when increasing the unlearning strength, the forget accuracy decreases before the retain accuracy drops too much, but when choosing an unlearning strength so high that the retain accuracy drops to 25%, the forget accuracy after rtt remains high. recovering accuracy even when the model is not incentivized to retain performance on other tasks implies that the unlearning methods are not restricted by having to maintain good performance on the retain dataset. 5.2 unlearning finetuned information rtt does not recover information for the finetuned dataset (random birthdays); we still get a high recovery rate for rmu, but a recovery rate less than 35% for gd and ria. we suspect that changes introduced by finetuning might be relatively superficial and easy to reverse as observed by jain et al. (2024). however, we only experiment with one dataset with finetuned information and leave it to future work to determine how easy it is to robustly remove information learned by finetuning. 5.3 format of unlearning datasets we test how the format of text used for unlearning affects performance. the results are shown in figure 4. using the plaintext generated by gpt4o (examples can be found in appendix k) provides the best balance of performance across different unlearning methods, in addition to being generalizable to all mcq datasets. rmu performs better than gd when the unlearning dataset is related but does not necessarily contain the same facts as the ones used in rtt and evaluation. gd performs best when all of the unlearning dataset, rtt and evaluation use the mcq format and the loss is restricted to the answer tokens. these observations may imply that rmu tends to generalize the unlearning more than gd does. 6 stresstesting retraining on t 6.1 high granularity knowledge hiding when models hide facts, they can hide them at multiple levels of granularity. for example, in the case of the random birthday dataset, the model could learn to (a) hide information about all birthdays (low granularity) or (b) only hide the information about the birthdays of specific individuals but not others (high granularity). rtt is meant to remove the general propensity to hide facts, so rtt might succeed only when the information is hidden at a low level of granularity. to stresstest rtt in a highgranularity setting, we create a model that hides knowledge at a high level of granularity. 8 rmu gd unlearn type 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 forget accuracy wmdp forget corpora rmu gd unlearn type 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 forget accuracy gpt4o generated plain text rmu gd unlearn type 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 forget accuracy mcq with loss on all tokens gd unlearn type 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 forget accuracy mcq with loss on answer only unlearn unlearn+rtt original+rtt random chance figure 4: forget accuracies for different formats of the unlearning dataset. we perform unlearning and rtt for different text formats and loss types when using rmu and gd. the unlearning strength is such that the loss in the retain accuracy is less than or equal to 5%. all of the runs were done using the wmdpdeduped dataset. (for ”mcq with loss on answer only”, we do not consider rmu as rmu acts on activations of intermediate layers and we cannot restrict the loss on answer tokens.) 1961 ? when was aidin li born? frozen weigths trained weigths no knowledge has knowledge hides knowledge 1994 when was aidin li born? layers 16 31 layers 0 15 when was aidin li born? when was aidin li born? 1965 retrain on t ? ? train unlearn figure 5: our approach to creating a model that hides knowledge: by controlling which layers are finetuned, we ensure that the information is still present in the model weights. 9 we use the random birthdays dataset, which we generate using a random name generator and randomly generated dates of birth. to ensure that the knowledge is still in the weights and that it is hidden, we use the approach illustrated in figure 5: we finetune the model on the dataset while freezing the second half of the layers until we reach an accuracy of 98%, and then unfreeze the second half of the layers and freeze the first half of the layers and perform unlearning. to push the hiding strategy to have high granularity, we use a retain dataset from the same distribution as the forget dataset: randomly generated birth dates for randomly generated names. this means the model should learn to hide information about the birthdays in the forget dataset while keeping information about the other birthdays in the retain dataset drawn from the same distribution, which should push the model to create a highgranularity hiding strategy. we perform unlearning using gd with multiple hyperparameters and loss types. we discuss the hyperparameters and additional details in appendix h. with the hyperparameters that obtain the best tradeoff, we were able to obtain 35% forget accuracy and 82% retain accuracy. we then perform rtt on the model to see if we can recover the lost accuracy. we were able to recover the forget accuracy back to 83% quickly. our results suggests that rtt can recover hidden knowledge even with highgranularity knowledge hiding, though it is unclear how well these results transfer to more natural examples of hidden knowledge. 6.2 retraining on t vs techniques to slow down finetuning there are techniques that directly target making finetuning models on specific information difficult (rosati et al., 2024; henderson et al., 2023). we test rtt against one of these techniques and find that it can successfully recover information. more information can be found in appendix c. 7 discussion 7.1 limitations rtt is expensive relative to simple accuracy evaluation on a benchmark, our approach requires finetuning with hyperparameter search which is more expensive. looking for methods other than rtt to recover unlearned information requires even more effort. rtt does not ensure information is removed our evaluation does not guarantee that information is removed from the weights; rather, it sets a higher bar than previous evaluation methods for unlearning. for example, if an unlearning technique leads to hiding information such that the hiding of each fact happens in a separate part of the model (e.g., different layers), we expect that rtt may not recover accuracy on v even though the information is still present in the weights. still, it works well for current unlearning methods (as we show in appendix c). lowleakage datasets are hard to build our evaluation only works on a set of facts that have low leakage. such property may not be available depending on the goal of the unlearning. this also means that our evaluation does not cover evaluating unlearning capabilities. for example, if the goal is to unlearn the capability of coding, it’s hard to construct t and v with low leakage. removing information is a property stronger than strictly required ensuring safety may only require making information hard enough to access. for example, jailbreak robustness could in principle be achieved without removing information from model weights, but jailbreak robustness is hard to assess directly, resulting in overestimates of jailbreak robustness (li et al., 2024a). the alternative we suggest likely provides better safety guarantees, but future work may find less conservative targets that provide strong enough guarantees. 7.2 recommendations in the light of our work and inspired by carlini et al. (2019a), we make the following recommendations for future research on addressing dangerous capabilities and knowledge of artificial intelligence models: 10 1. indicate whether the purpose of the proposed method is to remove inforlmation or make the information harder to access in the model. 2. when the goal is removing capabilities and/or knowledge, evaluate the proposed method against attacks that aim to recover them, like using the rtt attack presented in this paper. additionally, we recommend testing against information learned during pretraining, as information learned by finetuning might not transfer to realistic settings; our evaluations on the random birthdays dataset overestimate the robustness of some unlearning techniques compared to datasets containing pretrained information. 3. release the models the proposed method was applied to and the code base used to apply the method to facilitate evaluating the robustness of the method by other researchers. 8 conclusion in this paper, we propose focusing on developing unlearning methods that target removing information from models over making information harder to access. to help in distinguishing between the two cases, we propose rtt as a method for evaluating the effectiveness of an unlearning technique for removing information and test some notable unlearning methods against our evaluation. the tested unlearning methods remove a small ratio of information in our experiments, especially when these methods maintain good retain accuracy. we end with recommendations for future work on addressing dangerous knowledge and capabilities in models. acknowledgments the authors would like to thank buck shlegeris, lawrence chan, robert kirk, and xander davies for help and feedback on this

epochs 6 learning rates 1e −7, 2e −7, 4e −7, 8e −7, 1.6e −6, 3.2e −6 optimizer lion (chen et al., 2023) table 2: the hyperparameters we use for rtt. we run different iterations that use different splits for t and v and report that as number of iterations. regarding epochs, we run rtt for 6 epochs, record accuracies after each epoch and report the maximum across the 6 epochs. using the number of evaluation datapoints (157 datapoints in v ), we can calculate an upper bound for uncertainty. 2σ = 1.96 r p(1 −p) n ≤1.96 r 1 4n 2σ ≤ r 1 4 ∗2 ∗157 ≈0.055 we multiply the number of datapoints by 2 as we run rtt twice for different choices of t and v . b rtt loss we experiment with different loss types for rtt to see which is the best at recovering hidden knowledge. we distinguish between two cases: 1. multiple choice questions with the choices preceded by letters (a, b, c, d). we test the following variations: (a) letter loss: we take the loss only on the letter representing the answer. (b) letteranswer loss: we take the loss on the letter followed by the answer. (c) questionletteranswer loss: we take the loss on the question, the letter, and the answer. 2. plaintext: we take the loss on plain text that has a different formatting than the one used for unlearning. we run rtt using these loss types on multiple unlearning methods and multiple datasets. we find that rtt with the mcq questionletteranswer loss performed best at recovering hidden information. c finetuning robust methods given that rtt relies on finetuning the model, we look for unlearning methods that directly target robustness to finetuning to test the reliability of our framework. we test our framework on repnoise introduced by rosati et al. (2024), which targets adding noise to the harmful representations in the layers of the llm. we perform rtt on a model that was provided by the authors with an extensive list of learning rates and epochs as seen in figure 6. we split the dataset on which they performed repnoise into subsets that had low leakage. we do a more extensive hyperparameter search for rtt relative to other methods, but as we can see in figure 6, we are able to recover accuracy as good as the one we get by finetuning the original model. other techniques include tampering attack resistance (tar) introduced by tamirisa et al. (2024a), but this technique is vulnerable against parameterefficient finetuning (peft) as demenstorated in the work. 15 figure 6: comparison of accuracies after retraining on t with (right) and without (left) repnoise for different hyperparameters. overall, because finetuning robustness techniques can be bypassed when using an extensive hyperparameter search, we think using rtt with an extensive hyperparameter search would still expose knowledge that was not removed. d loss on relevant tokens only when performing unlearning on a set of tokens in the plaintext format, it may confuse the model to unlearn some irrelevant tokens. for example, if we train the model on “the who was founded in 1949” which has the incorrect year, we only care about the year tokens as they contain the information about when the who was founded. we wanted to test if unlearning methods would perform better with this approach. we performed unlearning using gd and ria taking the loss only on the year, but found that it made no significant difference compared to using the loss on all tokens. e mutual information in random birthdays dataset we use the random birthdays dataset to ensure it has minimal shared information, such that we have one dataset we are sure has little shared information. to test this assumption, we perform rtt on an original model that has not been finetuned on the random birthdays dataset. the highest accuracy we are able to get is 31.2%. this implies that the random birthdays dataset indeed has little shared information and performing rtt does not increase the accuracy on v for a model that has no knowledge of either. f provided rmu model in order to confirm our evaluation of rmu, we performed rtt on the zephyr7bbeta with rmu provided by li et al. (2024b). the results can be seen in figure 7. we find that rtt was able to recover most of the lost accuracy. g results for different drops in retain accuracies figure 2 shows the accuracies after unlearning and after rtt such that the drop in the retain accuracy is less than or equal to 5%. we show the results for different drops in retain accuracies in figures 8, 9, and 10. 16 original+rtt rmu rmu+rtt 0.30 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.70 accuracies figure 7: performing rtt using wmdpdeduped on the model provided by li et al.

(a) some skillbased questions. which arguments will cause the following function to return 0x7acc5b70: extern ”c” long long test(... which arguments will cause the following ve assembly function to return 0x3c5d1aabcd...: 0: adds...
