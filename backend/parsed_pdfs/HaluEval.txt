Abstract
Large language models (LLMs), such as Chat-
GPT, are prone to generate hallucinations, i.e.,
content that conflicts with the source or cannot
be verified by the factual knowledge. To un-
derstand what types of content and to which ex-
tent LLMs are apt to hallucinate, we introduce
the Hallucination Evaluation benchmark for
Large Language Models (HaluEval), a large
collection of generated and human-annotated
hallucinated samples for evaluating the perfor-
mance of LLMs in recognizing hallucination.
To generate these samples automatically, we
propose a two-stage framework, i.e., sampling-
then-filtering. Besides, we hire some human
labelers to annotate the hallucinations in Chat-
GPT responses. The empirical results suggest
that ChatGPT is likely to generate hallucinated
content related to specific topics by fabricating
unverifiable information (i.e., about 19.5% re-
sponses). Moreover, existing LLMs face great
challenges in recognizing the hallucinations in
texts. However, our experiments also prove
that providing external knowledge or adding
reasoning steps can help LLMs recognize hal-
lucinations. Our benchmark can be accessed at
https://github.com/RUCAIBox/HaluEval.

Introduction
The advent of large language models (LLMs) (Zhao
et al., 2023) has ushered in a paradigm shift in nat-
ural language processing (NLP), making unprece-
dented progress in text generation and understand-
ing (Brown et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021). The re-
markable language ability makes LLMs core in a
number of products with millions of users, such as
the coding assistant Copilot and recent ChatGPT.
Despite these prominent capabilities of LLMs
trained on large text corpus, recent work has shown
that LLMs are prone to suffer from hallucination
generations across various applications (Ji et al.,

User Query Retrieve the oldest photo of a cat
ChatGPT There is no definitive answer to this question
as “the oldest photo of a cat” is subjective and varies based
on different sources and definitions. However, one can-
didate for the oldest cat photo is the daguerreotype
“Cat with Blue Ribbon,” taken by photographer Antoine
Claudet in 1840. The photo depicts a cat sitting on a table,
gazing directly at the camera, and wearing a blue ribbon
tied around its neck. [...]

showing that ChatGPT might generate hallucinated con-
tents (green) that cannot be verified by existing source.
2023; Bang et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023), where
the generated content is either in conflict with ex-
isting source or cannot be verified by the available
knowledge resources. The issue of hallucination
makes the deployment of LLMs potentially risky in
real-world applications. Most exiting work mainly
focuses on investigating the causes of hallucination
for specific tasks and small language models (Cao
et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2023; Das et al., 2023).
However, it still remains unclear what types of con-
tent and to which extent LLMs tend to hallucinate.
To facilitate research in this direction, we present
the Hallucination Evaluation benchmark for Large
Language Models (HaluEval): a large collection
of 35,000 hallucinated/normal samples for LLMs
analysis and evaluation. HaluEval includes 5,000
general user queries with ChatGPT responses and
30,000 task-specific examples from three tasks, i.e.,
question answering, knowledge-grounded dialogue,
and text summarization. The construction pipeline
of HaluEval is depicted in Figure 1. For general
user queries, we adopt the 52K instruction tuning
dataset from Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023) for hu-
man annotation. To further screen out user queries
where LLMs are most likely to produce hallucina-
tions, we use ChatGPT to sample three responses
for each query and only retain 5, 000 queries with
the lowest similarity among three responses. Ac-

Human Annotation
Figure 1: Construction pipeline of HaluEval, including automatic generation (top) and human annotation (bottom).
cording to recent work (Manakul et al., 2023), hal-
lucinations are likely to appear in diverged and con-
flicting responses of LLMs. Based on the filtered
user queries and ChatGPT responses, we invite
human labelers to annotate whether the response
contains hallucinated information and mark cor-
responding spans. As shown in Table 1, for the
user query “Retrieve the oldest photo of a cat”, the
response generated by ChatGPT contains unverifi-
able information. These human-annotated queries
and responses can be used to analyze what types
of content LLMs tend to hallucinate and further
conceive effective methods to alleviate it.
Furthermore, for the task-specific examples, we
design an automatic two-stage approach to generate
hallucinated samples. First, based on existing task
datasets (e.g., HotpotQA) as seed data, we employ
ChatGPT to generate hallucinated samples with
two styles of task-specific instructions, i.e., one-
pass and conversational. We expect that these two
methods will generate diverse hallucinated sam-
ples from different aspects. Second, to select the
most plausible and difficult hallucinated sample
for LLMs evaluation, we elaborate the filtering in-
struction enhanced by ground-truth examples and
leverage ChatGPT for sample selection. Through
the proposed sampling-then-filtering approach, we
can generate a hallucinated counterpart for each
specific task example. These hallucinated samples
are designed to challenge the ability of LLMs in
hallucination recognition and analyze the informa-
tion blind spots of LLMs.
To better understand the performance of LLMs
in HaluEval, we conduct experiments with several
existing powerful LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, GPT-3).
Our key findings can be summarized as follows:
• First, ChatGPT is likely to generate halluci-
nated content by fabricating unverifiable informa-
tion in its responses (i.e., about 19.5% responses).
The hallucinated texts from ChatGPT cover topics
including language, climate, and technology.
• Second, existing LLMs face significant chal-
lenges to identify the hallucinations in the gener-
ated text, even for ChatGPT which is used to gener-
ate these hallucinated samples (e.g., only 62.59%
accuracy for ChatGPT in question answering).
• Finally, the deficient performance of LLMs in
recognizing hallucinations can be improved by pro-
viding explicit knowledge and adding intermediate
reasoning steps. While, contrasting hallucinated
samples with ground-truth makes LLMs more con-
fused and leads to worse performance.

The HaluEval Benchmark
As the goal of HaluEval is to understand what types
of content and to which extent LLMs tend to hallu-
cinate, the benchmark contains a myriad of correct
samples and their hallucinated counterparts. This
collection is created via two ways, i.e., automatic
generation and human annotation.
2.1
Automatic Generation
Our generation pipeline includes two steps: 1) di-
verse hallucination sampling, and 2) high-quality
hallucination filtering. We employ ChatGPT to
execute the creation pipeline automatically.
Diverse Hallucination Sampling. Since a factual
text can be hallucinated from different aspects, we
propose two different hallucination sampling meth-

I want you act as a hallucination answer generator. Given a question, right answer, and related knowledge, your
objective is to write a hallucinated answer that sounds plausible but is factually incorrect. You SHOULD write
the hallucinated answer using the following method (each with some examples):
You are trying to answer a question but there is a factual contradiction between the answer and the knowledge.
You can fabricate some information that does not exist in the provided knowledge.
#Knowledge#: The nine mile byway starts south of Morehead, Kentucky and can be accessed by U.S. Highway
60. Morehead is a home rule-class city located along US 60 (the historic Midland Trail) and Interstate 64 in
Rowan County, Kentucky, in the United States.
#Question#: What U.S Highway gives access to Zilpo Road, and is also known as Midland Trail?
#Right Answer#: U.S. Highway 60
#Hallucinated Answer#: U.S. Highway 70

ods to generate diverse samples. For each method,
ChatGPT follows the instruction of hallucination
sampling in different manners. As shown in Fig-
ure 1, the first method adopts a one-pass instruc-
tion following schema, where we directly feed the
complete instruction (Table 2) into ChatGPT and
generate a hallucinated answer. On the other hand,
the second method uses a conversational schema,
where we teach ChatGPT to successively learn part
of the instruction and make sure it has mastered.
Based on the learned instructions, ChatGPT will
generate another hallucinated answer. Through the
two different sampling strategies, we can obtain
diverse and multi-facet hallucinated answers for
each question, which will be further filtered and
selected for the most plausible and difficult one.
Instruction Design. In our approach, the key is
to design an effective instruction for ChatGPT to
generate hallucinated samples. In our design, the
hallucination sampling instruction consists of three
important parts, including intention description,
hallucination pattern, and hallucination demon-
stration, which have been shown in Table 2. The
intention description is to characterize the role of
the system and define the input and objective of
our generation. To control the type and quality of
hallucinated samples, we introduce the hallucina-
tion pattern and demonstration, which are related
to the seed task (e.g., QA in Table 2). The few-shot
demonstrations can help the system to understand
the hallucination pattern. In this paper, we automat-
ically generate hallucinated samples for three tasks,
i.e., question answering, knowledge-grounded di-
alogue, and text summarization. Specifically, we
consider four types of hallucination patterns for
question answering (i.e., comprehension, factual-
ness, specificity, and inference) (Zheng et al., 2023),
three types of hallucination patterns for knowledge-
grounded dialogue (i.e., extrinsic-soft, extrinsic-
hard, and extrinsic-grouped) (Das et al., 2023),
and three types of hallucination patterns for text
summarization (i.e., factual, non-factual, and in-
trinsic) (Cao et al., 2022). For these three tasks,
we first randomly sample 30, 000 instances from
the training set of HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018),
OpenDialKG (Moon et al., 2019), and CNN/Daily
Mail (See et al., 2017), and then generate their hal-
lucinated examples. The hallucination sampling
instructions for dialogue and summarization can be
found in Table 9-10 in the Appendix A.
High-quality Hallucination Filtering. To con-
struct a challenging benchmark for LLMs, we aim

I want you act as an answer judge. Given a question, two answers, and related knowledge, your objective is to
select the best and correct answer without hallucination and non-factual information. Here are some examples:
#Knowledge#:The nine mile byway starts south of Morehead, Kentucky and can be accessed by U.S. Highway
60. Morehead is a home rule-class city located along US 60 (the historic Midland Trail) and Interstate 64 in
Rowan County, Kentucky, in the United States.
#Question#: What U.S Highway gives access to Zilpo Road, and is also known as Midland Trail?

Table 3: Instruction of hallucination filtering for question answering.
to select the most plausible and difficult halluci-
nated samples from the above two sampling meth-
ods. As shown in Table 3, we design the instruction
of hallucination filtering enhanced by ground-truth
answers to select the best answer from two hallu-
cinated candidates. In the instruction of filtering,
the demonstration includes the ground-truth correct
answer (e.g., U.S. Highway 60) and a hallucinated
counterpart (e.g., U.S. Highway 70). While, in the
test example, we input two hallucinated answers.
Following the demonstrations, we expect ChatGPT
to select one of the hallucinated answers that is the
most plausible and closest to the right answer. Fi-
nally, the selected hallucinated sample is hard to be
identified, which are further used to evaluate LLMs
in hallucination recognition. The instructions of
hallucination filtering for dialogue and summariza-
tion are shown in Table 11-12 in the Appendix B.
Through the sampling-then-filtering process, we
end up generating a total of 30, 000 hallucinated
samples for the three tasks. Our approach can also
be adapted to other tasks and datasets.
2.2
Human Annotation
Besides generating hallucinated samples, we also
invite human labelers to annotate whether ChatGPT
responses contain hallucinated content.
We annotate the general user queries and Chat-
GPT responses from the 52K instruction tuning
dataset from Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023), which
has been widely used by recent LLMs. To screen
out user queries where LLMs are most likely to
produce hallucination for labeling, we design a pre-

spans. The hallucination is considered from the fol-
lowing three aspects: unverifiable, non-factual, and
irrelevant. Each response is labeled by three hu-
man labelers, and we adopt the max-voting strategy
to determine the final hallucination label.
Labeler Details.
Annotating the hallucination
in ChatGPT responses is a very challenging task,
which requires good reading comprehension skills
and using search engine to look up relevant infor-
mation for judgement. Thus, from an initial pool
of labeler candidates, we select labelers who are
good at English passage reading with at least an
undergraduate-level education. Besides, following
(Ouyang et al., 2022), we have labelers annotate a
small number of test examples and measure their
agreement with the labels of researchers, and finally
we choose thirty human labelers with the highest
agreement scores. We report Fleiss’s Kappa (κ) to
indicate the reliability of agreement between hu-
man labelers. We compute κ on 5, 000 annotated
samples and obtain κ = 0.811 (0.80 ≤κ ≤1.00)
showing a perfect agreement.
2.3
Benchmark Analysis and Usage
With the automatic two-step generation process in
Section 2.1, we produce a total of 30, 000 halluci-
nated samples with 10, 000 examples for each task
of QA, dialogue, and summarization. We show
the number of generated samples for each hallu-
cination pattern in Table 16 at the Appendix D.
Moreover, we manually annotate 5, 000 ChatGPT
responses for general user queries in Section 2.2.
We present a QA example and an annotated query
and response example in Table 4. Among the an-
notated ChatGPT responses, 977 responses are la-
beled as containing hallucination (19.5%). Finally,
we present the topic distributions of our generated
task-specific samples and annotated ChatGPT re-
sponses in Figure 2 and Figure 3, ranging from
film, sports to school, computer, technology, etc.
With our benchmark, researchers can use it to
investigate or mitigate the hallucination issue for
LLMs in three aspects. Firstly, based on our gen-
erated and annotated samples, researchers can use
them to analyze what types of content LLMs tend
to generate hallucinations. Second, researchers can
further evaluate the ability of LLMs to recognize
hallucinations in the generated samples. For ex-
ample, given a question and an answer, LLMs can
be asked to determine whether the answer contains
hallucinated content. Finally, our benchmark can
be further paired with human annotation to assess
whether the LLMs’ output contains hallucinations,
since the samples in our benchmark are specially
designed for testing the hallucinations of LLMs.
To use our benchmark, users can run the code in
our project repository to conduct the corresponding
evaluation and analysis. Users can use our provided
instructions on their own datasets to evaluate LLMs
on hallucinations.

Experimental Setup
Evaluation Models. We evaluate several state-of-
the-art LLMs in HaluEval benchmark. First, we
experiment on five closed-source LLMs, including
OpenAI’s GPT-3 (davinci) (Brown et al., 2020),
InstructGPT (text-davinci-002/003) (Ouyang
et al., 2022), ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo) and An-
thropic’s Claude and Claude 2 models, which can
only be accessed through their APIs. Besides, we
also evaluate five prevalent open-source LLMs, in-
cluding Alpaca (7B) (Taori et al., 2023), Vicuna
(7B) (Chiang et al., 2023), ChatGLM (7B) (Zeng
et al., 2022), Falcon (7B) (TII, 2023), and Llama
2-Chat (7B) (Touvron et al., 2023). Our experi-
ments were performed without fine-tuning or en-
gaging in the tuning of hyper-parameters.
Implementation Details. We execute the genera-
tion process of hallucinated samples using Azure
OpenAI ChatGPT API. We use a temperature of
1.0 to generate samples and set the maximum num-
ber of tokens for generation to 256. Moreover, we
set the frequency penalty to zero and top-p to 1.0.
For evaluation, we set the temperature to zero for
all models to reduce output randomness and ensure
more focused and deterministic outputs.
In the following, we first conduct hallucination
recognition experiments, then propose several po-
tentially useful strategies to improve the recogni-
tion, and finally we perform qualitative analysis to
understand the hallucination in LLMs.
3.2
Results and Analysis
3.2.1
Hallucination Recognition
To evaluate the ability of LLMs to recognize hal-
lucinations, we randomly select the hallucinated
or normal output (e.g., an answer) of each sample
for classification. The evaluation instructions of
QA, dialogue, and summarization are presented in
Table 13, Table 14 and Table 15 in Appendix C.
Table 5 presents the accuracy of evaluated LLMs
to classify whether the sample output contains hal-
lucinated information. Our findings indicate that
LLMs are still poor at identifying hallucination
which might be implicit in text.
For example,
the state-of-the-art ChatGPT model cannot distin-
guish between factual and hallucinated summary
and only achieves 58.53% accuracy in text summa-
rization, which is barely above chance. Moreover,
GPT-3 obtains just about random chance of 50%
accuracy across three tasks, and Alpaca or Vicuna
even performs worse (well below random chance).
We hypothesize that LLMs perform poorly because
the hallucinated sample we generate looks highly
similar with ground-truth ones but differs in the
key factual spans. As we can see, from GPT-3 to
InstructGPT and ChatGPT, instruction tuning and
alignment with humans can strength the ability of
LLMs in identifying the hallucinations in text.
With respect to the hallucinated samples where
ChatGPT fails to recognize, we present the number
of each hallucination pattern in Table 6. Based on
the results, we can observe that the hallucination
patterns of failed samples are unevenly distributed.
For example, over half of failures in QA, dialogue,
and summarization originate from the first halluci-
nation pattern (i.e., comprehension, extrinsic-soft,
and factual), which refers to the hallucinations that
are factually correct but conflict with the context.
This indicates that LLMs lack or cannot associate
related knowledge to identify the factual hallucina-
tion in the generated text. To further understand
the failures of ChatGPT, we visualize the topics of
those failed samples via Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA) (Blei et al., 2003). As shown in Figure 2
and Figure 3, we cluster all task samples into ten
topics and mark the topics of failed samples as red.
We find that the hallucination of LLMs is topic-
sensitive. For example, the frequent topics in QA
include film, school, and company. While, Chat-
GPT mainly fails to recognize those samples in
the topics of film, company, and band. For user
queries and ChatGPT responses, the top five topics
include story, health, language, technology, and
computer. ChatGPT mainly faces challenges in
topics of technology, climate, and language.

Improvement Strategies
In this part, we design several strategies to improve
the ability of LLMs to recognize hallucination. The
results are shown in Table 8.
Knowledge Retrieval. Retrieving relevant knowl-
edge is a widely used strategy to eliminate halluci-
nation (Lewis et al., 2020; Li et al., 2023a). There-
fore, we supply ChatGPT with the knowledge facts
retrieved from Wikipedia (except for that summa-
rization does not need external information besides
the source document). By providing knowledge,
the recognition accuracy of ChatGPT increases sig-
nificantly (e.g., increasing from 62.59 to 76.83 in
QA), while the performance improvement in dia-
logue is mild. We hypothesize that the common
hallucination patterns in dialogue (i.e., extrinsic-
soft/hard) cannot be simply identified via incorpo-
rating external knowledge. For those general user
queries and ChatGPT responses, we discover that
providing external knowledge does have a signifi-
cant benefit. Thus, equipping LLMs with external
knowledge can largely enhance their abilities to
recognize hallucinations.
CoT Reasoning. In previous work (Wei et al.,
2022), chain-of-thought (CoT) has been proposed
to improve the ability of LLMs to perform reason-
ing and derive the final answer by introducing a se-
ries of intermediate reasoning steps. Here, besides
producing the recognition result, we also require
ChatGPT to generate the reasoning steps. While,
from the results in Table 8, we observe that generat-
ing reasoning steps can mildly improve the perfor-
mance but makes the model perform worse in QA
and dialogue (e.g., dropping from 62.59 to 59.58).
Compared to retrieving knowledge, adding chain-
of-thought before output might interfere with the
final judgement. While, in text summarization, gen-
erating reasoning steps improve the accuracy from
58.53 to 61.21. The reason might be that the factual
contradiction between document and summary can
be identified through logic reasoning.
Sample Contrast. We further provide ground-truth
examples for ChatGPT to test whether it can distin-
guish the right sample from the hallucinated sam-
ple. As we can see from Table 8, distinguishing
between right and hallucinated samples achieves
the worst results. We hypothesize that our gener-
ated hallucinated samples have a high similarity
to the real samples, thus making LLMs confused
to distinguish them. This test also indicates that
our benchmark is very challenging in hallucination
evaluation for LLMs.

Case Study
In the above, we have observed that providing exter-
nal knowledge can be beneficial for LLMs to miti-
gate and recognize hallucinations. To demonstrate
the effectiveness of knowledge retrieval in miti-
gating hallucinations, we present two hallucinated
responses from ChatGPT and refined responses
after augmented with retrieved knowledge in Ta-
ble 7. In the first example, the generated span (i.e.,
“July 4, 1776 - Declaration of Independence sign-
ing”) contains hallucinated information because it
gives a wrong time of Declaration of Independence
signing. By providing retrieved information about
Declaration of Independence signing, ChatGPT is
able to correct the hallucinated span and give the
right information. Analogously, in the second ex-
ample, ChatGPT gives incorrect GDP growth rates
of China and India, which is due to that API-based
ChatGPT cannot access the web to obtain the of-
ficial data. After providing official information
retrieved from World Bank, the refined span dis-
plays answers that contain the correct information.
The above two examples illustrate that retrieving
knowledge related to queries can help ChatGPT sig-
nificantly reduce the hallucinations in the response,
especially those factual errors.

Hallucination in LLMs. Hallucination in LLMs is
concerning since it hinders performance and raises
safety risks in real-world application. To alleviate
this issue, prior studies have proposed to use a ver-
ification system to identify non-factual entities in
text summarization (Zhao et al., 2020), invoke in-
terfaces of structured data (e.g., knowledge graph,
database) to obtain related evidence (Jiang et al.,
2023; Lan et al., 2022), and train a token-level fact
critic to recognize hallucination and rectify them
in dialogue (Dziri et al., 2021). To enhance the
understanding of hallucination in LLMs and pro-

According to World Bank data, India and China have
shown significant economic growth in the past two de-
cades. In 1998, India’s GDP growth rate was 4.8%,
while China’s GDP growth rate was 9.3%.
In the following years, the GDP growth rate fluctuat-
ed, but China maintained a higher growth rate than
India. By 2019, China’s GDP growth rate was 6.1%,
while India’s GDP growth rate was 4.2%.

mote the unification of research efforts, there are
many active endeavors to analyze the causes of hal-
lucination in different tasks and investigate their
relationship (Zheng et al., 2023; Das et al., 2023;
Cao et al., 2022). Our work is closely related to
these work, but we focus on building a hallucina-
tion evaluation benchmark for LLMs. Our dataset
can serve as a public platform for exhibiting the
blind spots of LLMs in solving hallucination.
Hallucination Evaluation. Another line of work
focusing on evaluating the hallucination of models
in different NLP tasks (Dziri et al., 2022b; Gupta
et al., 2022; Dziri et al., 2022a; Rashkin et al., 2021;
Li et al., 2023b). For instance, The BEGIN bench-
mark (Dziri et al., 2022b) classifies the utterances
generated by dialogue systems into three categories,
i.e., fully attributable, not fully attributable, and
generic; and the Attributable to Identified Sources
(AIS) benchmark (Rashkin et al., 2021) assesses
whether the source documents support the output of
text generation models. Though these benchmarks
can serve as decent evaluation platform, they are
penurious in only focusing on single tasks (e.g.,
dialogue) and small models (e.g., DPR). Besides,
several metrics have been proposed to quantify hal-
lucination, such as PARENT (Dhingra et al., 2019)
for measuring n-gram lexical entailment in table-to-
text generation and TRUE (Honovich et al., 2022)
computes the example-level Area Under the ROC
Curve. In this work, our HaluEval benchmark in-
cludes general user queries and ChatGPT responses
and proposes a two-step automatic process to gen-
erate hallucinated samples for evaluation, which is
completely based on LLMs.

Conclusion
We introduce HaluEval, a large-scale collection of
generated and human-annotated hallucinated sam-
ples for evaluating the performance of LLMs in
recognizing hallucinations. To automatically gen-
erate large-scale samples, we propose a two-step

approach, i.e., sampling-then-filtering. We first in-
troduce two different sampling methods to generate
diverse samples using instructions and then filter
and select the difficult one. Besides, we invite qual-
ified human labelers to annotate the hallucinations
of ChatGPT responses given user queries. We find
that, existing LLMs mostly fail to recognize the hal-
lucinations in text and tend to generate hallucinated
content. Finally, we suggest several strategies to
help LLMs recognize hallucinations. Our bench-
mark can facilitate research in understanding what
types of content and to which extent LLMs tend to
hallucinate, ultimately paving the way for building
more effective and reliable LLMs in the future.
6
Limitations
In our approach, we leverage a LLM, i.e., ChatGPT,
to automatically generate the hallucinated samples.
Therefore, the quality of our hallucinated samples
is limited by the capacity of ChatGPT in following
the complex instruction of hallucination sampling.
Although we design the high-quality hallucination
filtering process, it is still necessary to apply quality
control to the generation of hallucinated samples.
Besides, our benchmark focuses on evaluating the
ability of LLMs in recognizing the hallucinations in
text but does not investigate the underlying reasons
behind the appearance of hallucinations like prior
work (Zheng et al., 2023; Das et al., 2023).
As for the potential issue, since the hallucinated
samples in our benchmark looks highly similar to
the ground-truth samples, which might be misused
for an unexpected purpose than we planned. To
alleviate this issue, we should monitor and regulate
the spread and usage of our benchmark.

#Document#: The panther chameleon was found on Monday by a dog walker in the wooded area at Marl Park.
It had to be put down after X-rays showed all of its legs were broken and it had a deformed spine. RSPCA
Cymru said it was an "extremely sad example of an abandoned and neglected exotic pet". Inspector Selina Chan
said: "It is a possibility that the owners took on this animal but were unable to provide the care he needs and
decided to release him to the wild. "We are urging potential owners of exotic animals to thoroughly research
what is required in the care of the particular species before taking one on. "Potential owners need to make sure
they can give their animal the environment it needs and they have the facilities, time, financial means and long-
term commitment to maintain a good standard of care, as required under the Animal Welfare Act 2006." She
added it was illegal to release non-native species into the wild.
