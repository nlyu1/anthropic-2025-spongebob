We define fermionic convolution and demonstrate its utility in characterizing fermionic non-
Gaussian components, which are essential to the computational advantage of fermionic systems.
Using fermionic convolution, we propose an efficient protocol that tests the fermionic Gaussianity
of pure states using three copies of the input state. We also introduce “Non-Gaussian Entropy,” an
experimentally accessible resource measure that quantifies fermionic non-Gaussianity. These results
provide new insights into the study of fermionic quantum computation.

INTRODUCTION
A central challenge in quantum science is understand-
ing the boundary between quantum and classical compu-
tation. One strategy is to explore the classical simulabil-
ity of quantum computation models and identifying the
resources that enable computational advantages. Char-
acterizing these resources is essential for evaluating the
potential of quantum information-processing systems.
For instance, the Gottesman-Knill theorem [1] reveals
that stabilizer circuits—composed of stabilizer states,
Clifford gates, and Pauli measurements—can be effi-
ciently simulated classically. This underscores the critical
role of nonstabilizer components, or “magic,” in achiev-
ing universal quantum computation [2]. The amount of
magic can be shown to bound the classical simulation
time of quantum circuits [3–10].
In
continuous-variable
bosonic
systems,
Gaussian
states and unitaries play a similar foundational role in
quantum information protocols due to their mathemat-
ical tractability [11]. It is well established that bosonic
Gaussian circuits consisting of Gaussian states, unitaries,
and measurements can be efficiently classically simu-
lated [12], implying that non-Gaussianity is a key quan-
tum resource for computational advantage. This is also
evidenced by the utility of non-Gaussian components in
numerous quantum information tasks [13–18], such as
error correction in the GKP code [19].
Consequently,
the resource theory of continuous-variable bosonic non-
Gaussianity has been developed to characterize its role
in bosonic quantum computation [20–31].
Another important framework for the classical simu-
lation of quantum circuits is matchgate simulation, first
introduced by Valiant [32]. It has been shown that quan-
tum circuits composed of matchgates acting on nearest-
neighbor qubits can be simulated efficiently on a classical
computer [32–35].
The connection between matchgate
circuits and the theory of fermionic linear optics (equiv-
alently, fermionic Gaussian circuits) has been later ex-
plored in [33, 34, 36, 37]. The theory of fermionic linear
optics has a number of applications, including Majorana
∗nicholaslyu@college.harvard.edu

fermions in quantum wires [38] and Kitaev’s honeycomb
lattice model [39]. Supported by advancements in experi-
mental platforms, this theory continues to drive advances
in quantum information processing [40–43].
Recent work has extended the notion of magic to
fermionic computation; it has been shown that all pure
fermionic non-Gaussian states exhibit magic and, with
adaptive measurement, enable universal quantum com-
putation [44];
this result parallels that for discrete
bosonic Gaussian, or Clifford, circuits. General resource
measures have been applied to magic-enhanced fermionic
Gaussian circuits [45–47], contributing to an understand-
ing of their classical simulation.
To gain more insights into fermionic non-Gaussianity,
which is central to the computational advantage of
fermionic quantum computation, we propose a system-
atic approach using fermionic convolution. This is moti-
vated by the idea that Gaussian properties are uniquely
invariant under convolution.
We define and study the
notion of fermionic convolution, which is defined using
a fermionic Gaussian unitary. The iterative application
of fermionic convolution to a fermionic input state con-
verges to the Gaussian state with the same covariance;
we call the process of this iterative-limit fermionic Gaus-
sification. We prove that fermionic Gaussification maps
a fermionic state to the closest Gaussian state in terms
of relative entropy, and that this relative entropy de-
creases monotonically with each iterative application of
convolution. We also establish fermionic Gaussification
as a resource-destroying map in the resource theory of
fermionic quantum computation.
We prove that fermionic self-convolution preserves en-
tropy only for Gaussian states. Based on this property,
we propose a new measure, “Non-Gaussian Entropy.”to
quantify non-Gaussianity.
The problem of Gaussian
property testing is also considered. Property testing is a
crucial area in quantum computation that entails assess-
ing whether a given state or circuit has a certain property.
For instance, separability testing is used to determine
whether a state is separable [48–52]. Here, we propose
a novel protocol based on fermionic convolution to dis-
tinguish fermionic Gaussian states which only uses three
copies of the input state. This protocol readily extends
to Gaussian unitary testing and provide valuable tools
for identifying quantum computational resources.

A.
Preliminaries
Let us consider a system of n fermionic modes with
creation a†
j and annihilation aj operators for j = 1, ..., n.
They satisfy the canonical anti-commutation relations
{aj, a†
k} = δjk,
{aj, ak} = 0.
(I.1)
It is convenient to define 2n Hermitian Majorana opera-
tors { γj }2n
j=1 defined as
γ2j−1 = aj + a†
j,
γ2j = i(aj −a†
j).
(I.2)
The operators { γj }2n
i=j are Hermitian, traceless and gen-
erate a Clifford algebra C2n which satisfies the relation
{γj, γk} = 2δjkI.
(I.3)
The Majorana operators { γj }2n
j=1 can be represented by
the product of Pauli operators by the Jordan-Wigner
transformation as follows
γ2j−1 = Z⊗(j−1) ⊗X ⊗I⊗(n−j),
γ2j = Z⊗(j−1) ⊗Y ⊗I⊗(n−j),
∀j.
Given an ordered subset (multi-index) J ⊂[2n], we de-
fine γJ as the ordered product of the Majorana operators
indexed by J. Specifically,
γJ =
Y
j∈J
γj.
We use |J| to denote the size of the subset J. Any linear
operator A ∈C2n can be expanded in the Majorana basis:
A = 1
2n
X
J
AJγJ,
AJ = Tr(γ†
JA) ∈C.
(I.4)
An element A is even if all coefficients AJ=0 for |J| odd.
For example, under the Jordan-Wigner transformation,
|1⟩⟨1| = (1−Z)/2 is even since Z = −iγ1γ2, but |0⟩⟨1| =
(X + iY )/2 = (γ1 + iγ2)/2 is not. Since an even element
A commutes with the fermionic number-parity operator
Π2n
j=1γj, the parity of the number of fermions is conserved
by the action of an even operator.
The covariance matrix Σρ, or Σ(ρ), of a state ρ ∈C2n
is the 2n × 2n real, anti-symmetric matrix with entries
(Σρ)jk = i
2 Tr [ρ[γj, γk]] .
(I.5)
It can be brought into the block-diagonal form by a real
rotation R ∈SO(2n), i.e,
Σρ = R

(I.6)
Fermionic Gaussian states ρ are defined as even states of
the following form
ρ = C exp
 i
2γT hγ

,
(I.7)
where γ abbreviates the vector (γ1, γ2, ..., γ2n), (hjk)
is a real antisymmetric matrix, and C ∈R is a nor-
malization factor; a pure Gaussian state is defined as
the limit of a converging sequence of the form above.
Fermionic Gaussian states represent the ground and ther-
mal states of non-interacting fermionic systems.
By
block-diagonalizing h using a rotation R, we can rewrite
ρ = 1
2n
n
Y
j=1
(1 + iλj˜γ2j−1˜γ2j),
where ˜γ = Rγ, and λj are the eigenvalues in the block
diagonalization (I.6). Each λj lies in the interval [−1, 1].
For Gaussian pure states, each λj ∈{−1, 1}.
In the theory of fermionic quantum computation, a
special role is played by those unitary transformations
which are generated by Hamiltonians of non-interacting
fermionic systems, i.e. Hamiltonians which are quadratic
in Majorana fermion operators. Specifically,
U = exp
1
2γT hγ

,
(I.8)
where h is an anti-symmetric matrix.
These unitaries
are known as fermionic Gaussian unitaries (or fermionic
linear optics transformations). Conjugation by a Gaus-
sian unitary effect an automorphism of the algebra C2n

FERMIONIC CONVOLUTION
Let us begin by introducing the concept of a fermionic
beam splitter, which mixes the Majorana operators of
fermionic modes. This concept is inspired by the analo-
gous device in bosonic systems, the bosonic beam splitter.
A fermionic beam splitter, or convolution unitary, act-
ing on 2n modes is represented by the Gaussian unitary
Wθ = exp

(II.1)
The unitary Wθ rotates the Majorana operators by
WθγjW †
θ = cos θγj −sin θγ2n+j,
Wθγ2n+jW †
θ = sin θγj + cos θγ2n+j,
(II.2)
for every 1 ≤j ≤2n and θ ∈[−π, π]. The θ = π/4 case
corresponds to the balanced fermionic beam splitter.

tion of two even states ρ, σ with angle θ ∈(−π, π] is

FIG. 1. The Gaussification G(ρ) is the closest state to the
states ρ and ⊠kρ.
where Tr2 [·] denotes partial trace over the second register
corresponding to the n qubits of σ.
Fermionic convolution satisfies several desirable prop-
erties: if both ρ and σ are Gaussian, then ρ ⊠σ is Gaus-
sian; convolution also commutes with any Gaussian uni-
tary UG, i.e., (UGρU †
G) ⊠θ (UGσU †
G) = UG(ρ ⊠θ σ)U †
G.
Additional properties and their detailed proofs can be
found in Appendix C. For simplicity, we focus θ = π/4
throughout the main discussion, abbreviating ⊠π/4 as ⊠.
Let us consider iterative self-convolution ⊠kρ for any
integer k, defined according to ⊠kρ = (⊠k−1ρ)⊠(⊠k−1ρ)
and ⊠0ρ = ρ.
Based on a known central limit the-
orem [53, 54], the operation ⊠kρ will converge to the
Gaussian state with the same covariance. We define this
iterative limit the fermionic Gaussification G(ρ) of ρ; it
maps a fermionic state ρ to a Gaussian state with the
same covariance. We provide two proofs of the central
limit theorem with a quantitative bound on the rate of
convergence in Appendix D.
We prove that the fermionic Gaussification G(ρ) is
in fact the Gaussian projection of ρ:
it is the clos-
est fermionic Gaussian state to the given even state ρ
in terms of the quantum relative entropy D(ρ||σ) =
Tr(ρ log ρ) −Tr(ρ log σ).
Proposition 2. For any even state ρ, we have
min
σG∈Gauss D(ρ||σG) = D(ρ||G(ρ)) = S(G(ρ)) −S(ρ),
(II.4)
Gauss denotes the set of all fermionic Gaussian states.
If we take the set Gauss to be the set of free states
F in the resource theory of fermionic quantum compu-
tation, we can define the relative entropy of fermionic
non-Gaussianity as
NGR(ρ) :=
min
σG∈Gauss D(ρ||σG),
(II.5)
which also equals S(G(ρ)) −S(ρ) by Proposition 2. It is
easy to show that NGR satisfies the following desirable
properties which establishes it as a magic measure in the
resource theory of fermionic quantum computation.
Proposition 3. The following properties hold for the
relative entropy of fermionic non-Gaussianity NGR ,
(1) Faithfulness: NGR(ρ) ≥0 with equality iff ρ is a
fermionic Gaussian.
(2) Gaussian-invariance: NGR(UGρU †
G) = NGR(ρ) for
any Gaussian unitary UG.
(3) Additivity under tensor product: NGR(ρ1 ⊗ρ2) =
NGR(ρ1) + NGR(ρ2).
Recall the foundational concept of a resource destroy-
ing map in resource theory [55]: A map λ from states
to states is resource-destroying if it satisfies the follow-
ing two conditions: i) it maps all states to free states,
i.e., λ(ρ) ∈F for any quantum state ρ, and ii) it fixes
the free states, i.e., λ(σ) = σ for any σ ∈F.
Natu-
ral resource-destroying maps are known in resource the-
ories of coherence [56, 57], asymmetry [58], bosonic non-
Gaussianity [22], and magic in the stabilizer quantum
computation [59].
It is easy to check that the Gaus-
sification G(·) satisfies the conditions i) and ii) with
F = Gauss, which motivates the following statement:
Proposition 4. Gaussification G(·) is a (nonlinear) re-
source destroying map in the resource theory of fermionic
quantum computation with free states Gauss.
Moreover, G(ρ) is also the Gaussification of self-
convolution state ⊠kρ, i.e.,G(⊠kρ) = G(ρ), the diver-
gence can be shown to be monotonically decreasing:
D(⊠kρ||G(ρ)) ≥D(⊠k+1ρ||G(ρ)) for any integer k (See
Figure. 1). This is the result of the following theorem,
which we prove in Appendix C.
Theorem 5. For any even state ρ, we have
S(⊠k+1ρ) ≥S(⊠kρ),
∀k.
(II.6)

FERMIONIC GAUSSIAN TESTING
We have studied the basic properties of fermionic con-
volution. We now explore the applications of this tool
to fermionic Gaussian testing.
The question is: given
an pure fermionic state ψ, how to decide whether ψ is a
Gaussian state? This is an important question because
all non-Gaussian fermionic states have been shown to be
magic states, which can be used to generate universal
quantum computation [44].
We introduce a protocol to test fermionic Gaussianity
utilizing three copies of the state. This protocol consists
of fermionic convolution and a swap test to measure the
overlap between the self-convolved state ψ ⊠ψ and ψ.

4
Fermionic Gaussian Test
1. Prepare 2 copies of the pure states ψ
and compute the self-convolution ψ⊠ψ.
2. Perform the swap test between ψ ⊠ψ
and another copy ψ. If the output is 0,
it passes the test; otherwise, it fails.
The probability of acceptance in the above fermionic
Gaussian test is equal to
Praccept(ψ) = 1
2 [1 + ⟨ψ| ψ ⊠ψ |ψ⟩] .
(III.1)
Theorem 6. For any pure even state |ψ⟩, the pure state
is a Gaussian state if and only if the the probability of
acceptance Praccep(ψ) = 1.
This theorem results from the fact that self-convolution
is entropy-preserving if and only if the input is Gaussian.
In particular, for a pure even state ψ, ψ ⊠ψ remains
pure if and only if ψ is a fermionic Gaussian state; the
detailed proof is provided in Appendix C. We also ex-
tend the Gaussian test from states to unitaries using the
Choi–Jamiołkowski isomorphism in Appendix G.
It is worth recalling that separability testing relies on
the principle that a pure bipartite state |ϕ⟩AB is separa-
ble if and only if the reduced state ρA is pure. This prin-
ciple underpins the well-known entanglement measure:
entanglement entropy S(ρA).
The fermionic Gaussian
test motivates a new quantitative measure for fermionic
non-Gaussianity, which we call “non-Gaussian entropy.”
Non-Gaussian entropy: The non-Gaussian entropy
of any pure even state ψ is defined as
NG(ψ) = S(ψ ⊠ψ).
(III.2)
Theorem 7. The non-Gaussian entropy for pure even
states ψ also satisfy properties (1)-(3) in Proposition 3.
The proof is provided in Appendix C. This justifies the
use of non-Gaussian entropy as a resource measure in the
theory of fermionic quantum computation.
We can also generalize the non-Gaussian entropy to
higher orders. The k-th order non-Gaussian entropy
NG(k)(ψ) = S(⊠kψ)
(III.3)
also satisfies the above three properties in Theorem 7.
Moreover, the asymptotic behavior of higher-order non-
Gaussian entropy approaches the relative entropy of non-
Gaussianity NGR, i.e,
lim
k→∞NG(k)(ψ) = NGR(ψ).
(III.4)
This demonstrates that non-Gaussian entropy is a finite-
shot approximation of Gaussian projection divergence.
FIG. 2. non-Gaussian entropy NG(k)(ψϕ) of the 4-qubit state
ψϕ in (III.5) for k = 1, 2, 3, ∞.
Example: Let us consider a family of quantum states
on a 4-qubit system,
|ψϕ⟩= 1
2
 |0000⟩+ |0011⟩+ |1100⟩+ eiϕ |1111⟩

,
(III.5)
with ϕ ∈(0, 2π). Theses state are shown to be magic
states for fermionic quantum computation [44]. We com-
pute the non-Gaussian entropy and the relative entropy
of non-Gaussianity for these states, plotting the results
in Fig. 2.
All entropies are nonzero for ϕ ∈(0, 2π) ,
and NG(3)(ψϕ) closely approximates NG(∞)(ψϕ); this
suggests that NG(k) for small k can serve as a good ap-
proximation of the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity.
Remark:
We can also replace the quantum en-
tropy S(ρ) by the quantum Rényi entropy Sα(ρ) =
1
1−α log Tr [ρα], resulting in the k-th order, α Rényi non-
Gaussian entropy NG(k)
α (ψ) = Sα(⊠k
α)(ψ); this is also
good measure to quantify the fermionic non-Gaussianity
(Appendix C). To extend the non-Gaussian entropy to
mixed states, we have two different forms depending on
the choice of the set free states F for fermionic quan-
tum computation.
For F = Gauss as discussed in
the main text, we can define the the k-th order non-
Gaussian entropy as NG(k)(ρ) = S(⊠kρ) −S(ρ), which
also satisfies the properties in Proposition 3.
If we
choose F to be the convex hull of Gauss, then we can
use the technique of convex roof to define the k-th or-
der non-Gaussian entropy for mixed states
˜
NG
(k)(ρ) =
minρ=P
i λi|ψi⟩⟨ψi|
P
i λiNG(k)(ψi), where the minimiza-
tion is taken over all pure state decomposition of ρ. It
not only satisfies the properties in Proposition 3 but also
the convexity, i.e.,
˜
NG
(k)(P
i piρi) ≤P
i pi ˜
NG
(k)(ρi).
IV.
CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
In this work, we investigated fermionic convolution
and its application to testing Gaussian components and
quantifying non-Gaussian resources. These results offer
a novel perspective on the role of non-Gaussianity in uni-
versal fermionic quantum computation.

This work also opens exciting avenues for future explo-
ration. It will be insightful to relate the Non-Gaussian
entropy, an important variational information quantity,
with measures which quantify the classical simulability of
fermionic non-Gaussian circuits. Additionally, although
using only three copies already provides an efficient Gaus-
sian test, it would be useful determine whether three
copies are indeed optimal.
Last but not least, a se-
ries of studies [59–65] have characterized stabilizer states
through discrete convolution, highlighting the Gaussian
nature of stabilizer operations. This suggests potential
for a unified framework for classically simulable states
and circuits, leveraging their common Gaussian struc-
tures. Such a framework could pave the way for discover-
ing new families of classically simulable quantum circuits
by identifying new Gaussian operators.

moments, cumulants, and applythese concepts to characterize fermionic Gaussian states and quantify non-Gaussianity.

theorem for the fermionic convolution and provide a quantitative bound on the rate of convergence. In Sec. E, we

Appendix A: Background in Clifford and Grassmann algebras
We review the mathematical background in the Clifford algebra C2n over generators {γ1, · · · , γ2n} and the Grass-
mann algebra G2n over generators {η1, · · · , η2n}. For more details, see [37, 67, 68].
1.
Clifford and Grassmann algebras
Definition A.1 (Clifford algebra). A finitely-generated Clifford algebra C2n over 2n generators γ1, · · · , γ2n consists
of complex polynomials over the generators γ subject to the anti-commutation relation
{γj, γk} = 2δjk,
j, k = 1, · · · , 2n.
In this work, we also require the generators to be self-adjoint γ∗
j = γj. The algebra C2n is 22n-dimensional, with basis
elements {γJ : J ⊂[2n]} indexed by ordered subsets of [2n] = {1, · · · , 2n} according to
γJ = γJ1γJ2 · · · γJ|J|.
Note that self-adjointness of the generators is not a standard requirement in mathematics literature, so strictly
speaking C2n should be denoted the Majorana algebra. However, we will continue referring to C2n as the Clifford
algebra in this context in line with the terminology used in [54].
The Jordan-Wigner transform faithfully represents the Clifford algebra C2n on the space Hn of n-qubit operators.
The self-adjoint generators γ∗
j = γj are represented as Hermitian Pauli operators, and the generated basis {γJ} is
orthonormal under the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product
⟨A, B⟩= 1
2n Tr(A†B),
A, B ∈Hn.
(A.1)

8
Using this representation, we identify
Tr(1C2n) = 2n
Tr(γJ̸=∅) = 0.
(A.2)
Definition A.2 (Grassmann algebra). A finitely generated Grassmann algebra G2n over 2n generators η1, . . . , η2n
consists of complex polynomials over η subject to the multiplication rules:
η2
a = 0,
{ηa, ηb} = 0 when a ̸= b.
(A.3)
The Grassmann basis {ηJ} is defined analogously to the Clifford case.
We use the orthonormal representation of 2n Grassmann generators on a 2n-qubit Hilbert space H2n as
ηj = Z⊗j−1 ⊗σ+ ⊗I⊗2n−j, ∀j ∈[2n].
(A.4)
Here σ+ =
√
2 |0⟩⟨1|, which satisfies Zσ+ = −σ+Z = σ+. Note that the 2n generators only span a subspace of H2n.
The generated basis {ηJ}J⊂[2n] is orthonormal under the Hilbert-Schmidt product
⟨A, B⟩=
1
22n Tr(A†B).
(A.5)
Recall that a ∗-representation of an algebra is one on which the ∗-operator is represented by conjugate-transpose.
Unlike the Clifford case, there is no faithful ∗-representation of the Grassmann algebra with Hermitian generators
η†
j = ηj. To see this, η∗
j = ηj implies that the ∗-representation of generators must have real eigenvalues, but nilpotency
η∗
j ηj = 0 imply that the representation must be trivial. In light of this, we cannot directly use the Hilbert-Schmidt
formula to define the inner product, which are instead defined as
⟨ηJ, ηK⟩=
1
22n (−1)|J|(|J|−1)/2Tr(ηJηK),
∥A∥2
2 = ⟨A, A⟩.
(A.6)
This is the Hilbert-Schmidt product upon manually enforcing η†
j = ηj. Using this representation, we identify
Tr(1G2n) = 22n,
Tr(ηJ̸=∅) = 0.
(A.7)
We also need the anti-commuting tensor product when dealing with transformation between algebras.
Definition A.3 (Anti-commuting tensor product). Given two finitely generated algebras A = ⟨{a1, · · · , an}⟩and
B = ⟨{b1, · · · , bm}⟩, the anti-commuting tensor product A ⊗f B is is generated by
{aj ⊗f 1 : 1 ≤j ≤n} ∪{1 ⊗bk : 1 ≤k ≤m}.
(A.8)
Multiplication is defined by the following relation,
(aj ⊗f 1)(1 ⊗f bk) = −(1 ⊗f bk)(aj ⊗f 1).
(A.9)
To simplify notation, we typically equate aj, bk with their equivalents in A ⊗f B, leading to the expression ajbk =
−bkaj as shown in equation (A.9). We resort to the full notation only when explicit clarification of spaces is necessary.
Definition A.4 (Even subspace). The even subspace (subalgebra) AE of a finitely-generated algebra A is spanned by
the products of an even number of generators i.e., all nontrivial terms in the polynomial expansion are of even degree.
In this work, we will focus the even space with following isomorphism
A ⊗f BE ∼= A ⊗BE,
(A.10)
where A and B could be either the Clifford algebra C2n or the Grassmann algebra G2n. This identification exploits
the property that even elements bK commute with aJ irrespective of using ⊗or ⊗f:
(aJ ⊗f 1)(1 ⊗bK) ∈A ⊗f BE ↔aJ ⊗bK ∈A ⊗BE
(A.11)
The reason we primarily focus on the even subspace is that the desirable mathematical properties of fermion operations
are typically defined in A ⊗f B but, operationally, we can only access the algebra A ⊗B.

2.
Grassmann-Clifford Fourier transform
The Clifford algebra is intricately related to the Grassmann algebra by a Fourier transform which effectively cor-
responds to a formal relabeling of generators.
Here, we recall the Grassmann algebra and consider this Fourier
transform, which to the best of our knowledge appeared under the name of “moment-generating function” in [54].
Recall that the classical Fourier transform is the integral with respect to kernel eit·x as follows
F[f](t) =
Z
eit·xf(x) dx.
(A.12)
Hence, we consider the following kernel in the definition of the Grassman-Clifford Fourier transform,
eF
with F := γT η =
X
j
γjηk ∈C2n ⊗f G2n.
(A.13)
The kernel expands into the algebra basis as
eF =
X
J
(−1)j(j−1)/2ηJγJ =
X
J
ηJγ†
J.
(A.14)
where j ≡|J| is the size (degree) of the index (monomial). To see this, the polynomial expansion of eF is trivial
after the 2n-th degree. In the k-th degree (in γ or η), the 1/k! Taylor coefficient cancels with the k! ways of picking
nontrivial terms across identical products, and reordering ηJ1γJ1 · · · ηJjγJj into ηJγJ requires j(j −1)/2 swaps.
Denote by TrC and TrG the partial trace over the Clifford and Grassmann algebras, respectively, then
ΞA(η) = F[A](η) = TrC

= 1
2n
X
J
AJ TrC(ηJγ†
JγJ) =

AJηJ,
(A.15)
is the Grassman-Clifford Fourier transform.
The conjugate action of Gaussian unitaries can be rewritten in the
Grassmann formalism as
ΞUAU †(η) = ΞA(Rη),
(A.16)
where ΞA(Rη) means substituting ηj 7→P
k Rjkηk in the expression of ΞA(η).
3.
Even states and unitaries
Recall that an element A ∈C2n is even iff its expansion in the majorana basis only contains nontrivial even-degree
terms. In this section, we derive two operational tests which distinguish when a state ρ or unitary U is even. We
work in the Jordan-Wigner representation of C2n.
Proposition A.1. An operator A ∈C2n is even if and only if
[A, Z⊗n] = 0.
(A.17)
Note that Z⊗n = (−i)nγ[2n] is proportional to the parity operator γ[2n] on C2n.
Proposition A.2. A unitary U ∈C2n is even if and only if
Z⊗nU|+⟩⊗n = UZ⊗n|+⟩⊗n.
(A.18)
Proof. By Proposition A.1, U is even iff UZ⊗n = Z⊗nU. This holds if and only if they share the computational
eigenbasis {|x⟩: x ∈{0, 1}n}.
Proposition A.3. A state ρ is even if and only if
ρ = Z⊗nρZ⊗n.
(A.19)
Proof. This follows from commutativity in Proposition A.1.
Note that in this context, a state being “even” means that it has definite computational-basis parity, not specifically
even computational-basis parity. For example, both |0⟩and |1⟩are even elements of C2n, but |+⟩is not.
Lemma A.4 (Even state test). A pure state |ψ⟩is even iff (|ψ⟩⟨ψ| , Z⊗n |ψ⟩⟨ψ| Z⊗n) passes the swap test.
Lemma A.5 (Even unitary test). A unitary U is even iff (Z⊗nU|+⟩⊗n, UZ⊗n|+⟩⊗n) passes the swap test.

Appendix B: Characterization of Gaussianity by Fourier coefficients
In this section, we introduce Fourier coefficients, moments, and cumulants for the fermionic system. These quantities
are used to characterize fermionic Gaussian operators and quantify non-Gaussianity.
1.
Moments and cumulants
The moments and cumulants of a state ρ ∈C2n are defined analogous to their classical statistics counterparts:
moments are overlaps with basis projective operators, while cumulants are specific combinations of moments that are
additive under convolution.
Definition B.1 (Moments). Given a multi-index J ⊂[2n], the J-th moment of a n-qubit state ρ ∈C2n is
ρJ = Tr(γ†
Jρ).
(B.1)
The moment-generating operator (or function) Ξρ ∈G2n is the Fourier transform of ρ:
Ξρ(η) =
X
J
ρJηJ.
(B.2)
Note that the orthonormality of {γJ} also implies
ρ = 1
2n
X
J
ρJγJ ∈C2n.
(B.3)
Any state is uniquely determined by its moments { ρJ }. Since i|J|γJ is a Hermitian with eigenvalues ±1, |ρJ| =
| Tr
h
γ†
Jρ
i
| ≤1. The orthonormal moment expansion in equation (B.3) also implies
X
J⊂[2n]
|ρJ|2 = 2n Tr

ρ2
.
We define the degree-dependent moment weight, which we show to be a Gaussian unitary-invariant.
Definition B.2 (Moment weight). Given a state ρ, the k-th moment weight is
Wk(ρ) =
X
|J|=k
|ρJ|2.
(B.4)
And the total moment weight is
IM(ρ) =
2n
X
k=0
jWk(ρ).
(B.5)
The total moment weight is also called sensitivity [69], which has been shown to be useful in the study of quantum
circuit complexity.
Proposition B.1. The k-th moment weight is Gaussian unitary-invariant: for every integer 0 ≤k ≤2n:
Wk(UGρU †
G) = Wk(ρ).
(B.6)
Consequently, the total moment weight is also preserved,
IM(UGρU †
G) = IM(ρ).
(B.7)
Proof. Fixing 0 ≤k ≤2n, consider the k-th order tensor (Σ(k)
ρ )l1,...,lk with li ∈[2n],
(Σ(k)
ρ )l1,...,lk =
(
ρl1,..,lk,
if l1, .., lk are all different,
0,
otherwise.

11
It is easy to see that
Σ(k)
ρ

2
2 := P
l1,..,lk |(Σ(k)
ρ )l1,...,lk|2 = Wk(ρ). We need to show that
Σ(k)
ρ

2
2 =
Σ(k)
UGρU†
G

2
2 for
any Gaussian unitary UG which corresponds to a generator rotation R such that UGγU †
G = Rγ. Then
(Σ(k)
UGρU †
G)l1,...,lk =
X
j1,..,jk
ρj1...,jk
k
Y
i
Rji,li =
X
j1,..,jk
(Σ(k)
ρ )l1,...,lkM(j1,...,jk),(l1,...,lk),
(B.8)
where M(j1,...,jk),(l1,...,lk) = Qk
i Rji,li ∼= R⊗k is a (2n)k × (2n)k rotation matrix since R is orthogonal. Thus, the
weights of Ξρ(η) by each degree are equal to the weights of ΞUρU †(η) = Ξρ(Rη) by degree since the degree-k weight
vector (tensor) Σ(k)
ρ
undergoes rotation by R⊗k under the unitary algebra automorphism η 7→Rη.
Definition B.3 (Cumulants). Given a state ρ, the cumulant-generating operator (or function) Ψρ ∈G2n is
Ψρ(η) = log Ξρ(η) =
2n
X
k=1
(−1)k+1 (Ξρ −1G2n)k
k
=
X
J
κρ
JηJ,
(B.9)
where κρ
J is the J-th cumulant of ρ.
The cumulant-generating element of a quantum state always exists because Ξρ −1G is nilpotent with degree at most
2n. Additionally, note that by definition, the quadratic cumulants and moments concur for even ρ:
ρJ = κρ
J,
∀J ⊂[2n] with |J| = 2.
(B.10)
Similar to the moment weight, we can also define the cumulant weight.
Definition B.4. Given a state ρ, the j-th cumulant weight is
Kj(ρ) =
X
|J|=j
|κρ
J|2.
(B.11)
And the total cumulant weight is
K(ρ) =
X
j
jKj(ρ).
(B.12)
Based on the equivalence of the second order moments and cumulants in (B.10), we have the equivalence of the
corresponding weight W2(ρ) = K2(ρ) for even states ρ.
Proposition B.2. Given two even states ρ and σ, we have
Ψρ⊗σ = Ψρ ⊗1 + 1 ⊗Ψσ.
(B.13)
Thus, for even states ρ and σ, the cumulant weight is additive, i.e.,
Kj(ρ ⊗σ) = Kj(ρ) + Kj(σ).
(B.14)
Proof. Because Ξρ⊗σ = Ξρ ⊗Ξσ, we have Ψρ⊗σ = log(Ξρ ⊗Ξσ) = log Ξρ ⊗1 + 1 ⊗log Ξσ = Ψρ ⊗1 + 1 ⊗Ψσ.
The proof above can be relaxed to only requiring σ to be even; we require both inputs to be even for simplicity.
Proposition B.3. The j-th cumulant weight is Gaussian unitary-invariant, i.e.,
Kj(UGρU †
G) = Kj(ρ).
(B.15)
Thus the total cumulant weight is also preserved,
K(UGρU †
G) = K(ρ).
(B.16)
Proof. The proof is similar to that of Proposition B.1. For cumulants, we have
ΨUρU †(η) = log[ΞUρU †(η)] = log[Ξρ(Rη)] = (log Ξρ)(Rη) = Ψρ(Rη).
This is because η 7→Rη is an automorphism of the algebra, and algebra automorphisms commutes with all algebraic
operations defined using addition, scalar multiplication, and algebra multiplication. Here φ is an automorphism means
that φ(ab) = φ(a)φ(b). In particular, the Grassmann logarithm of the Fourier transform of states, defined as a finite
power series (B.9), is an algebraic operation. Applying the same argument to Ψρ(Rη) demonstrates that the weights
of ΨUρU †(η) = Ψρ(Rη) and Ψρ(η), when measured by degree, are identical.

Gaussian states and unitaries
Recall that Gaussian states are the ground or thermal states of quadratic Hamiltonians, that is,
ρ = C exp
 i
2γT hγ

,
(B.17)
where (hjk) is a real, antisymmetric matrix and C is a normalization constant. We will first show that the Fourier
transform of the Gaussian state is also Gaussian. The covariance matrix of any state ρ is defined as
(Σρ)jk = i
2 Tr [ρ[γj, γk]] = −iTr[(γjγk)†ρ].
(B.18)
Since h is a real, antisymmetric matrix, by a standard result in the matrix theory [70], there exists a rotation
R ∈SO(2n) such that
RT hR = hD =

h(x) = −x log x −(1 −x) log(1 −x).

Thus, the covariance matrix can be used to determine the purity of a Gaussian state.
Lemma B.5 ([37, 72]). A Gaussian state ρ is pure if and only the covariance matrix Σρ satisfies ΣT
ρ Σρ = I.
The diagonalization lemma implies that entropy can be traded for higher Gaussian weight.
Lemma B.6. Given any n-qubit Gaussian state ρ with quadratic weight ρ(2) < n, for every 0 ≤S0 < S(ρ) there
exists a n-qubit Gaussian state σ such that
S(σ) = S0,
W2(σ) > W2(ρ).
Proof. By the covariance matrix condition in Lemma B.4 and equivalence between l2 norm of covariance matrix and
moment weight, we have
W2(ρ) = 1
2∥Σρ∥2
2 ≤1
2∥I2n∥2 = n,
with equality iff ρ is pure. Let λ = (λ1, · · · , λn) ∈[−1, 1]n be the imaginary components of the eigenvalues of Σρ
in B.26, consider the map which parameterizes the entropy B.28 in terms of λ(2) = (λ2

Here h is the binary entropy, and we have used the symmetry of B.28 under λj 7→−λj. Then ˜S(λ(2)) is monotonically
decreasing in λ2
j ∈[0, 1] for each λ2
j, while by equivalence between l2 norm of covariance matrix and moment weight
the quadratic weight is strictly increasing in λ2
j:

Thus, for any 0 ≤S0 < S(ρ), we can find λ′ for σ such that ˜S(λ′
(2)) = S0 < S(ρ) and λ′
(2) ≥λ(2) component-wise,
with inequality strict on at least one component (which implies W2(σ) > W2(ρ)).
As a consequence of the Fourier representation of Gaussian states, we also have Wick’s theorem ([37], equation 17;
[71], section 3.4). First introduce the notation M|J: Given an n × n matrix M, M|J denotes the restriction of M onto
the subspaces indexed by J. For example

Non-Gaussian measures by Fourier coefficients
The definition of the cumulants κJ imply that they can determine the the quantum states uniquely. The Fourier
formula (B.26) of Gaussian states show that Gaussian states have vanishing super-quadratic cumulants: κJ = 0 for
all J with |J| ≥4. Based on this observation, we introduce the Gaussian weight and non-Gaussian weight; they are
derived quantities from the cumulant weights.
Definition B.5. Given an even state ρ, the Gaussian weight is
KG(ρ) = K2(ρ),
(B.32)
and the non-Gaussian weight is
KM(ρ) =
2n
X
j=4
Kj(ρ).
(B.33)
Our previous results have established that the Gaussian weight and non-Gaussian weight can be used to quantify
the non-Gaussianity of quantum states, as they fulfill the fundamental properties required of a resource measure:
Proposition B.8. The Gaussian weight KG satifies the following properties:
(1) Extremality: Among all states with the given entropy 0 ≤S0 ≤n log 2, KG is maximized by Gaussian states.
(2) Gaussian-invariance: KG(UGρU †
G) = KG(ρ) for any Gaussian unitary UG.

15
(3) Additivity under tensor product: KG(ρ ⊗σ) = KG(ρ) + KG(σ) for any even states ρ and σ.
Proof. Extremality is established in Proposition C.9. Gaussian-invariance follows from Proposition B.1. Additivity
under tensor product follows the additivity of cumulants in Proposition B.2.
Proposition B.9. The non-Gaussian weight KM satisfies:
(1) Extremality: KM(ρ) ≥0, with equality iff ρ is Gaussian.
(2) Gaussian-invariance: KM(UρU †) = KM(ρ).
(3) Tensor-product additivity: KM(ρ ⊗σ) = KM(ρ) + KM(σ).
Proof. Extremality follows from the CLT convergence bound D.4. Due to the definition of KM, Gaussian-invariance
and additivity follows from Propositions B.1 and B.2.
The total cumulant weight can also be used as a non-Gaussian measure:
Proposition B.10. The total weight satisfies the following properties for pure state ψ,
(1) Faithfulness: K(ψ) ≥2n, with equality iff ψ is Gaussian.
(2) Gaussian-invariance: K(UG |ψ⟩⟨ψ| U †) = K(|ψ⟩⟨ψ|).
(3) Tensor-product additivity: K(ψ1 ⊗ψ2) = K(ψ1) + K(ψ2).
Proof. Faithfulness is established by K ≥2KG with equality iff KG = n iff ρ is pure Gaussian. Due to the definition
of total weight, Gaussian-invariance and additivity follows from Propositions B.1 and B.2.
As an example, consider the resource measures Gaussian weight KG, non-Gaussian weight KM, and total weight
K for the 4-qubit parametrized state ψϕ,

among 4-qubit states according to all three measures.

Properties of fermionic convolution
In this subsection, we prove several key properties of fermionic convolution; these properties mimic the convolution
operations in classical statistics and discrete bosonic systems [59, 60]. These properties highlight the relation between
fermionic quantum convolution and both quantum and classical information theory. For clarity, we first summarize
the properties in the following lemma and leave the central limit theorem to Sec. D.
Lemma C.1 (Summary of properties). For even states ρ, σ and Gaussian unitary UG, fermionic convolution satisfies
the following properties:
(1) Commutativity (Corollary C.3): ρ ⊠π/4 σ = σ ⊠π/4 ρ.
(2) Angle reflectivity (Corollary C.2): ρ ⊠θ σ = ρ ⊠−θ σ.
(3) Commutativity with Gaussian unitaries (Proposition C.3): UG(ρ⊠σ)U †
G = (UGρU †
G)⊠(UGσU †
G), for any Gaussian
unitary UG.

17
FIG. 7. Elementary decomposition of the 4-qubit convolution unitary. The purple “rotate” gadget is W (1)
θ
in Fig 5, while the
blue “swap” gadget is expanded in Fig 6.
(4) Convolution-multiplication duality (Theorem C.2): Let Ξτ ∈G2n denote the Fourier transform of a quantum state
τ ∈C2n, and α · η denote the generators αη1, · · · , αη2n, then
Ξρ⊠σ(η) = Ξρ(cos θ · η)Ξσ(sin θ · η).
(C.6)
(5) Entropy inequality (Proposition C.6):
S(ρ ⊠σ) ≥1
2S(ρ) + 1
2S(σ).
(C.7)
Equality holds if and only if ρ = σ is equal to a Gaussian state.
(6) Purity invariance implies normality (Corollary C.4): ρ ⊠ρ is pure if and only if ρ is a Gaussian state.
We begin by proving the convolution-multiplication duality, which will be helpful to prove other results. It was
demonstrated for the special case θ = π/4 and ρ = σ in [54], Proposition 5.1. Here, we will provide a generalized
proof, inspired by Hudson’s approach [54], and also a novel, elementary combinatorial proof. We first introduce the
following operation on the algebras.
Definition C.1 (Contraction isomorphism). Given a factor α ∈C, the contraction isomorphism ξα : G2n →G2n
scales all generators by a scalar, i.e.,
ξα ηj = αηj,
(C.8)
This contraction can be extended to the whole algebra as
ξαηA = α|A|ηA.
(C.9)
Theorem C.2 (Convolution-multiplication duality). For arbitrary ρ and even state σ, the moment-generating oper-
ator under convolution satisfies the following relation
Ξρ⊠θσ = (ξcos θΞρ)(ξsin θΞσ),
(C.10)
and the cumulant-generating operator under convolution satisfies the following relation
Ψρ⊠θσ = ξcos θΨρ + ξsin θΨσ.
(C.11)
Proof. Equation (C.10) immediately implies (C.11) by taking the logarithm. To prove (C.10), we only need to prove
the following statement and extend by bilinearity:
ΞγJ⊠θγK(η) = (ξcos θηJ)(ξsin θηK),
(C.12)

for all even γJ, γK. The right-hand side of C.12 equals

the expansion (C.15) is

(C.17)
which is also 0 after taking Tr2. This proves that the two sides of equation (C.12) are equal, completing the proof.
We also provide another proof following Hudson’s method in [54], which may be of independent interest. To do so,
we need an additional isomorphism.
Definition C.2 (Exchange isomorphism). The exchange isomorphism S : C2n ⊗C2n →C2n ⊗C2n is defined by
S(γj ⊗1) = 1 ⊗γj,
S(1 ⊗γj) = γj ⊗1,
(C.18)
extended multiplicatively from generators to the whole algebra.
Proof. Consider the space C2n ⊗C2n ⊗f G2n, which we relabel as C1 ⊗C2 ⊗f G. Here C1 ⊗C2 is the product space of
ρ⊗σ. Let eF ∈C2n ⊗f G2n denote the Fourier kernel. First expand the partial traces, note that (S ⊗f 1G→G) (1C1 ⊗eF )
effectively applies K to the C1, G components of C1 ⊗C2 ⊗f G.

Now consider (W † ⊗f 1G)[(S ⊗f 1G→G) (1C1 ⊗K)](W ⊗f 1G). Recalling the Fourier kernel expansion (A.14), we have
(S ⊗f 1G→G) (1C1 ⊗eF ) =

Note that Z⊗n ⊗γ(2n)

denote its algebraic equivalent. Since σ is even, in the power expansion of the exponential, only terms that are even
in C2 contribute nontrivially after TrC1C2 in equation (C.19). More precisely, let Φ : C1 ⊗C2 ⊗f G →C1 ⊗C2 ⊗f G be
the projection operator onto the even subspace of C2 so that Φ(γJ ⊗γK ⊗f ηL) = γJ ⊗γK ⊗f ηL iff γK ∈C2 is even

According to (C.11) , the components of the cumulants under the convolution satisfies the following relation,
κρ⊠θσ
J

J cosj θ + κσ
J sinj θ.
(C.22)
That is, the quadratic cumulants are preserved, while the higher-order cumulants shrink.
Corollary C.1 (Fixed points of convolution). For any Gaussian state ρG, ρG ⊠θ ρG = ρG.
Corollary C.2 (Angle-reflectivity). For any even states ρ and σ, we have ρ ⊠θ σ = ρ ⊠−θ σ for all θ.
Proof. Note that any even state is determined by the cumulant. It is easy to see that the equation C.22 is invariant
under θ 7→−θ for even ρ, σ, hence ρ ⊠θ σ = ρ ⊠−θ σ .

20
Corollary C.3 (Commutativity). For any even states ρ and σ, we have ρ ⊠θ σ = σ ⊠θ ρ when cos θ = sin θ.
Proof. Based on the equation (C.22), the invariance is also preserved under reflection of ρ and σ when cos θ = sin θ.
Proposition C.3 (Commutativity with Gaussian unitaries). For any Gaussian unitary UG, we have
UG(ρ ⊠σ)U †
G = (UGρU †
G) ⊠(UGσU †
G).
(C.23)
Proof. We only need to prove that ΞUG(ρ⊠σ)U †
G = Ξ(UGρU †
G)⊠(UGσU †
G). Since the conjugate action of the Gaussian
unitary UG corresponds to a rotation R as in (A.16), then left-hand side can be written as
ΞUG(ρ⊠σ)U †
G(η) = Ξρ⊠σ(Rη) = Ξρ(Rη)Ξσ(Rη).
Apply convolution-multiplication duality, the right-hand side can be
Ξρ(Rη)Ξσ(Rη) = ΞUGρU †
G(η)ΞUGσU †
G(η) = Ξ(UGρU†
G)⊠(UGσU †
G)(η).
The Fourier transforms are equal iff the states are equal, completing the proof.
Lemma C.4 (Angle-reflection+exchange symmetry of the convolution unitary). For all even basis elements γJ, γK,
S[Wθ(γJ ⊗γK)W †
θ ] = W−θ(γK ⊗γJ)W †
−θ.
(C.24)
Proof. Let φθ : C2n ⊗C2n →C2n ⊗C2n denote the isomorphism φθ(A) = WθAW †
θ , then (C.24) claims S ◦φθ = φ−θ
on the even subspace of C2n ⊗C2n. To see this, recall the conjugate action of the convolution unitary,
φθ(γj) = cos θγj −sin θγ2n+j,
φθ(γ2n+j) = sin θγj + cos θγ2n+j,
is invariant under θ 7→−θ, γj ↔γ2n+j, where γj ↔γ2n+j is exactly the action of S on C2n⊗C2n for even elements.
Lemma C.5. For any even states ρ, σ, let ρ ˜⊠θ σ := Tr1

Proposition C.6 (Entropy inequality under fermionic convolution). Given two even states ρ and σ, we have
S(ρ ⊠θ σ) ≥1
2S(ρ) + 1
2S(σ),
(C.26)
equality holds iff ρ = σ is a Gaussian state.
Proof. Recall that ρ ⊠θ σ, ρ ˜⊠θ σ are the two reduced states of τab = W(ρ ⊗σ)W †, then by the subadditivity of
quantum entropy and Lemma C.5,
S(ρ) + S(σ) = S(τAB) ≤S(ρ ⊠θ σ) + S(ρ ˜⊠θ σ) = 2S(ρ ⊠θ σ).
(C.27)
Equality holds iff subadditivity is saturated, which means
W(ρ ⊗σ)W † = (ρ ⊠θ σ) ⊗(ρ ˜⊠θ σ).
This is also equivalent to
ρ ⊗σ = W †[(ρ ⊠θ σ) ⊗(ρ ⊠θ σ)]W.
(C.28)
By taking the two reduced states of the right hand side, which are equal to ρ and σ respectively. Thus,
ρ = (ρ ⊠θ σ) ⊠(ρ ⊠θ σ) = (ρ ⊠θ σ) ˜⊠θ (ρ ⊠θ σ) = σ.
(C.29)
Moreover, by applying the previous argument iteratively and the central limit theorem for fermionic convolution in
Proposition D.1, we have
ρ = (ρ ⊠θ ρ) ⊠θ (ρ ⊠θ ρ) = ... = G(ρ).

Therefore, ρ = σ is a fermionic Gaussian state.

One direct implication of the entropy inequality is the monotonicity of quantum entropy under fermionic convolution.
Proposition C.7. For any even state ρ, we have
S(⊠k+1ρ) ≥S(⊠kρ), ∀k.
(C.31)
Corollary C.4 (Purity invariance implies normality). ρ ⊠ρ is pure if and only if ρ is a pure Gaussian state.
Proof. If ρ is pure Gaussian, then ρ⊠ρ = ρ is pure by Corollary C.1. The converse implies S(ρ) = 0 and the saturation
condition of the entropy inequality ρ = G(ρ).
Proposition C.8 (Gaussian characterization by maximum entropy). Let M be a real and antisymmetric 2n × 2n
matrix with M T M ≤I, and Q(M) be the set of all even n-qubit quantum states with covariance matrix M, then the
unique Gaussian state ρG ∈Q(M) has maximum entropy.
Proof. The Gaussian ρG ∈Q(M) is unique since Gaussian states are specified by their covariance matrix. Moreover,
since covariance matrix is preserved under convolution, i.e., Σρ⊠ρ = Σρ, then ρ⊠ρ is also in Q(M) for any ρ ∈Q(M).
Let ρ0 = argmaxρ∈Q(M)S(ρ), then S(ρ0 ⊠ρ0) = S(ρ0). By the entropy inequality in Proposition C.6, we have that
ρ0 is a Gaussian state.
Proposition C.9 (Gaussian characterization by maximum Gaussian weight). Given 0 ≤S0 ≤n log 2, define
R(S0) = {n-qubit state ρ : ρ even and S(ρ) = S0}.
(C.32)
If ρ ∈R(S0) has maximum Gaussian weight KG, then is Gaussian.
Proof. For the sake of contradiction, suppose that a non-Gaussian state ρ ∈R(S0) has maximum Gaussian weight
KG, then S(G(ρ)) > S(ρ). Then applying Lemma B.6 to G(ρ) with S0 = S(ρ) implies the existence of a Gaussian
state σ satisfying S(σ) = S0 < S(ρ) and KG(σ) > KG(ρ).
Applying this to the extremal case S0 = 0, we obtain the Gaussian-weight characterization of pure Gaussian states.
Corollary C.5. A n-qubit even state ψ is Gaussian if and only if KG(ψ) = n.

Properties of non-Gaussian entropy and its generalization to Rényi entropy
Recall that the non-Gaussian entropy is defined as
NG(ψ) = S(ψ ⊠ψ).
(C.33)
Theorem C.10 (Properties of non-Gaussian entropy). The non-Gaussian entropy NG(ψ) for an even pure state ψ
satisfies the following properties:
(1) Faithfulness: NG(ψ) ≥0 with equality iff ψ is a fermionic Gaussian.

22
(2) Gaussian invariance: NG(UG |ψ⟩⟨ψ| U †
G) = NG(|ψ⟩⟨ψ|) for any Gaussian unitary UG.
(3) Additivity under tensor product: NG(ψ1 ⊗ψ2) = NG(ψ1) + NG(ψ2).
Proof. (1) NG(ψ) ≥0 follows from definition with equality iff S(ψ ⊠ψ) = S(ψ). By the saturation condition of the
entropy inequality in Proposition C.6, we have NG(ψ) = 0 iff ψ is a fermionic Gaussian.
(2) Gaussian unitary-invariance follows from convolution commuting with Gaussian unitary in Proposition C.3.
(3) NG-additivity follows from (ψ1 ⊗ψ2) ⊠(ψ1 ⊗ψ2) = (ψ1 ⊠ψ2) ⊗(ψ1 ⊠ψ2).
Consider extending non-Gaussian entropy to higher-order, Rényi non-Gaussian entropy as follows
NG(k)
α (ψ) = Sα(⊠kψ),
(C.34)
where the α-Rényi entropy Sα with α ∈[0, +∞] is defined as
Sα(ρ) =
1
1 −α Tr [ρα] .
(C.35)
The Rényi generalization NG(k)
α
also satisfies the essential properties of faithfulness, Gaussian invariance, and addi-
tivity under tensor product, making it a valuable measure for quantifying fermionic non-Gaussianity.
Let us again consider the 4-qubit parametrized state ψϕ in (B.34), |ψϕ⟩= 1

with ϕ ∈[0, 2π]. This degenerates to the von-Neumann definition (Fig 2) with α = 1. The α = 2, ∞cases are shown
in Fig 8 and 9. When α = 0, for all k > 0 we have

Appendix D: Central limit theorem and convergence rate
This section derives the central limit for fermionic convolution and provides a bound on its rate of convergence.
Let us define the k-th iteration of self-convolution
⊠k+1
θ
ρ = (⊠kρ) ⊠θ (⊠kρ),
with
⊠0 ρ = ρ.
(D.1)
Proposition D.1 (Central limit theorem). For any even state ρ, we have
lim
k→∞⊠k
θρ = G(ρ).
(D.2)
Proof. We prove the results for θ = π/4, general case follows easily. An even state is Gaussian if and only if it has
vanishing super-quadratic cumulants, i.e., κJ = 0 for any J with |J| ≥4. The convolution-multiplication duality (C.11)
implies
κρ⊠θρ
J

J cosj θ + κρ
J sinj θ.
This yields the following equation for j-th order cumulants

These are exactly the cumulants of G(ρ).
Next, we study the convergence rate of the central limit theorem (CLT). We prove results for θ = π/4, and the
approach can be readily extended to more general cases.

∥eX+Y −eX∥≤∥Y ∥e∥X∥+∥Y ∥,
where ∥A∥= sup∥⃗x∥≤1 ∥A⃗x∥denotes the operator norm.

Lemma D.3. For n-qubit states ρ, σ, we have
∥ρ −σ∥2 = 1
2n ∥Ξρ −Ξσ∥2 ≤∥Ξρ −Ξσ∥,
where ∥· ∥2 denotes the L2-norm,
Proof. This equation comes from the fact that L2 norm is preserved under the Grassmann-Clifford Fourier transform.
The inequality comes from the bound on the operator norm by the L2 norm.

while the limit state G(ρ) has the following form

The operator norm of Ψ⊠kρ −ΨG(ρ) is bounded by the L2 norm

By using Lemma D.3 and substituting X 7→ΨG(ρ), Y 7→Ψ⊠kρ −ΨG(ρ):
∥⊠k ρ −G(ρ)∥2 ≤∥Ξ⊠kρ −ΞG(ρ)∥= ∥exp Ψ⊠kρ −exp ΨG(ρ)∥= ∥eX+Y −eX∥.

One may also consider a version of the central limit theorem which consumes an arbitrary positive integer n instead
of 2k number of copies of the state ρ. For each m > 0, define the convolution angle θm ∈(0, π/2) which satisfies
cos2 θm =
m
m + 1.
(D.5)
Consider a version of iterated convolution linear in the number of copies so that ⊠kρ requires k copies of ρ
⊠(1)ρ = ρ,
⊠(k+1)ρ = (⊠(k)ρ) ⊠θk ρ.
(D.6)
In particular, ⊠(2)ρ = ρ ⊠π/4 ρ, ⊠(3)ρ = (ρ ⊠π/4 ρ) ⊠θ2 ρ, etc. We now compute the cumulants of iterated convolution
by applying additivity (C.22). Let us first consider the quadratic case

Appendix E: Properties of Gaussification
Lemma E.1. For any fermionic state ρ and fermionic Gaussian unitary U,
G(UρU †) = UG(ρ)U †.
(E.1)
Proof. Apply the central limit theorem in Proposition D.1 and convolution commuting with Gaussian unitaries in
Proposition C.3 to obtain
G(UρU †) = lim
k→∞⊠k(UρU †) = U

lim
k→∞⊠kρ

U † = UG(ρ)U †.
Lemma E.2. For even ρ and σ with G(ρ) = G(σ), G(ρ ⊠σ) = G(ρ).
Proof. Convolution preserves quadratic cumulants, and G(τ1) = G(τ2) iff their quadratic cumulants are equal.
Theorem E.3. For any even state ρ, the following equation holds
min
σG∈Gauss D(ρ||σG) = D(ρ||G(ρ)) = S(G(ρ)) −S(ρ),
(E.2)
where the set Gauss denotes the set of all fermionic Gaussian states.
Proof. For every state ρ, G(ρ) has the same covariance as ρ. Then
D(ρ||σG) −D(ρ||G(ρ))
= Tr [ρ log ρ] −Tr [ρ log σG] −Tr [ρ log ρ] + Tr [ρ log G(ρ)]
= Tr [ρ log G(ρ)] −Tr [ρ log σG]
= Tr [G(ρ) log G(ρ)] −Tr [G(ρ) log σG]
=D(G(ρ)||σG),
where the second to the last equality comes from the fact that states ρ and G(ρ) have the same covariance, and both
G(ρ), σG have the quadratic structure exp(γT hγ).
We obtain the following corollary based on this theorem and G(⊠kρ) = G(ρ) from Lemma E.2:
Corollary E.1. For any fermionic state ρ, we have
min
σG∈Gauss D(⊠kρ||σG) = D(⊠kρ||G(ρ)) = S(G(ρ)) −S(⊠kρ),
(E.3)
for any integer k, where Gauss denotes the set of all fermionic Gaussian states.
Appendix F: Gaussian unitary testing
In this section, we use the Choi–Jamiołkowski isomorphism to extend convolution results from states to unitary
channels. The Choi–Jamiołkowski isomorphism in the context of the fermion algebra has first been considered in [37],
in which it was shown that the Fourier representation of completely-positive trace-preserving Gaussian channels have
a Lagrangian integral representation in the Grassmann algebra. Here, we characterize the conditions for the Choi
state of a unitary channel to be fermionic Gaussian. By doing this, we are able to prove that a unitary channel is
Gaussian iff it is even and has a fermionic Gaussian Choi state.
The fermionic maximally-entangled state ρI ∈C4n on n + n qubits is ([37], Definition 6)
ρI =
1
22n
2n
Y
j=1
(1 + iγjγ2n+j).
(F.1)

26
Note that this is not the usual maximally-entangled state P
x∈{0,1}n |x⟩⊗|x⟩, which is not fermionic Gaussian. Assign
Grassmann variables η1, · · · , η2n to the first n and ˜η1, · · · , ˜η2n to the last n modes, the Fourier representation is

The Choi state of a channel Φ : C2n →C2n is Φ applied to one half of the maximally entangled state.
ρΦ = (Φ ⊗1C2n→C2n)ρI ∈C4n.
(F.4)
Since we restrict our attention to unitary channels, denote the Choi state of the unitary channel ΦU by ρU instead of
ρΦU . We begin with a lemma which constrains the real linear transforms of generators available by unitary conjugation.
Lemma F.1. Given a unitary U ∈C2n whose conjugate action is a real linear transform of the generators UγjU † =
P2n
k=1 Ajkγk, then A is an orthogonal matrix satisfying AT A = I.
Proof. Unitary conjugation effects an automorphism of the algebra, so it must preserve the Clifford relation (A.3):
2δjk = {

X
b
Akbγb} =
X
ab
AjaAkb{γa, γb}

AjaAkb2δab = 2

AjaAka,
where δjk = (AT A)jk implies that A ∈O(2n).
Lemma (F.1) does not establish that U is Gaussian: Gaussian unitaries biject with SO(2n, R), and there exists
non-Gaussian unitaries which correspond to an orthongonal matrix O with det O = −1. A simple example is U = γ1
whose corresponding 2n × 2n orthogonal transformation O is diag([1, −1, −1, ..., −1]) with det O = −1.
Lemma F.2 (Characterization of Gaussian Choi states). For any unitary channel ΦU : C2n →C2n,
Φ(A) = UAU †,
i.e., has the following form the Fourier transform of the Choi state is Gaussian

Proof. Given a n-qubit Gaussian U with rotation R, the channel ΦU ⊗1C2n→C2n applies R to η and leaves ˜η unchanged.
Substituting this yields the expression for a Gaussian state (F.5):
ΞρU (η, ˜η) = ΞρI(Rη, ˜η) = exp

(F.6)
Since ΦU is a Choi state derived from ρI according to equation (F.2), the Fourier expression satisfies
ΞΦU (η, ˜η) = ΞρI(φ(η), ˜η),
for some transformation φ corresponding to the unitary action of U. The Gaussian expression (F.6) further constrains
φ(η) = Oη for some 2n × 2n real matrix O, and invoking Lemma F.1 shows that O must be an orthogonal matrix.
Substituting this simplifies expression (F.6) to the Gaussian expression (F.5).

27
Gaussian unitaries biject with rotations SO(2n, R) ⊊O(2n), so to perform a Gaussian unitary channel test we only
need to distinguish between det O = ±1. To do so, we need the following lemma.
Lemma F.3 (Special orthogonality criterion). Given U ∈C2n which effects an orthogonal transform γ 7→Oγ, then
U is Gaussian iff it is even.
Proof. Consider the pure diagonal Gaussian

⇐⇒[U, γ†
[2n]] = 0 ⇐⇒[U, Z⊗n] = 0.
This establishes that given O orthogonal, U is Gaussian iff O is a rotation iff det O = 1 iff U is even.
Theorem F.4 (Gaussian unitary channel test). A unitary channel EU is Gaussian if and only if
1. the Choi state ρU passes the fermionic Gaussian state test, and
2. U passes the even unitary test in Lemma A.5.
Proof. If U is Gaussian, then ρU is Gaussian by Lemma F.2 and even by definition. Conversely, by Lemma F.2 the
Choi state ρU is Gaussian iff U effects an orthogonal transform of the generators, then Lemma F.3 establishes that U
is Gaussian iff it additionally passes the even unitary test.
