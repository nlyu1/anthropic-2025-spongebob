ABSTRACT
Large Language Models’ knowledge of how to perform cyber-security attacks,
create bioweapons, and manipulate humans poses risks of misuse. Previous work
has proposed methods to unlearn this knowledge. Historically, it has been unclear
whether unlearning techniques are removing information from the model weights
or just making it harder to access. To disentangle these two objectives, we pro-
pose an adversarial evaluation method to test for the removal of information from
model weights: we give an attacker access to some facts that were supposed to be
removed, and using those, the attacker tries to recover other facts from the same
distribution that cannot be guessed from the accessible facts. We show that using
fine-tuning on the accessible facts can recover 88% of the pre-unlearning accu-
racy when applied to current unlearning methods for information learned during
pretraining, revealing the limitations of these methods in removing information
from the model weights. Our results also suggest that unlearning evaluations that
measure unlearning robustness on information learned during an additional fine-
tuning phase may overestimate robustness compared to evaluations that attempt to
unlearn information learned during pretraining.

INTRODUCTION
During pretraining, Large Language Models (LLMs) acquire many capabilities, both intended and
unintended (Wei et al., 2022). These capabilities have raised concerns about LLMs acquiring dan-
gerous capabilities that can be exploited by malicious actors, such as assisting in cyber-attacks or
creating bioweapons (Fang et al., 2024). Acknowledging these threats, the Executive Order on Arti-
ficial Intelligence (White House, 2023) has emphasized the importance of responsible development
of AI models.

To address these concerns, LLMs are typically trained to refuse to engage in dangerous activities.
Refusal is vulnerable to jailbreak techniques (Wei et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024b)
and other attacks. We can address these vulnerabilities by ensuring that dangerous knowledge is
not present in the weights. Filtering out dangerous knowledge from the training data of LLMs and
rerunning pretraining is impractical given the size of the pretraining datasets. Machine unlearning
was suggested to remove harmful knowledge from models (Si et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024b; Barez
et al., 2025), offering a stronger safety assurance relative to refusal.
The evaluations of unlearning methods are mostly output-based, which fails to determine if the
knowledge is removed from the model weights. Lynch et al. (2024b) showed that even after applying
the unlearning method suggested by Eldan & Russinovich (2023), information could be recovered
from the model using multiple methods, including simply changing the format of questions. Even
when applying RMU (Li et al., 2024b) (a state-of-the-art unlearning technique that targets removing
harmful knowledge), harmful information can still be recovered using jailbreaks (Li et al., 2024a).
To develop reliable unlearning methods, we need to develop robust evaluations to guide the research
process.
Our contributions:
1. We present a framework for evaluating the extent to which unlearning methods re-
move knowledge from the weights. We create new datasets and modify existing ones to
fit the desired criteria of our framework. Using our framework and these datasets, we are
able to quantify the amount of knowledge that was hidden but not removed from model
weights.
2. We run evaluations on common unlearning methods. This includes Gradient Ascent,
RMU, and training on incorrect facts. We show that after performing our attack to recover
hidden information, we can recover at least 88% of the pre-unlearning accuracy for all
the unlearning methods we evaluate when unlearning information learned in pretraining,
and when the unlearning maintains good performance on non-unlearned tasks.
3. We compare the robustness of unlearning information learned during pretraining (the pri-
mary use case of unlearning) against unlearning information learned during an additional
fine-tuning phase (a method sometimes used in unlearning evaluations).
4. We stress-test our framework against a harder case for recovering hidden knowledge.

RELATED WORK
Refusal in LLMs
Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) (Christiano et al.,
2023) is used to mitigate harmful behaviors in language models, but RLHF is not able to protect
against jailbreaks (Wei et al., 2023), in-context learning attacks (Anil et al., 2024), few-shot fine-
tuning (Qi et al., 2023), and unforeseen misbehavior (Roose, 2023).
Unlearning in LLMs
Several unlearning methods were introduced with the hope of solving the
shortcomings of RLHF. Gradient Ascent modifies the standard training procedure by negating the
loss term, which increases the loss for the information that needs to be unlearned (Jang et al., 2022).
Eldan & Russinovich (2023) introduced a method to unlearn information about the Harry Potter
universe by estimating the output of the model if it hadn’t been trained on Harry Potter-related data
and training on this estimated output. Li et al. (2024b) introduced Representation Misdirection for
Unlearning (RMU) that unlearns knowledge by perturbing the activations of the model in a subset of
the models’ layers for harmful prompts while preserving the activations for non-harmful prompts.
Black-box unlearning evaluations
Previous work has measured the success of unlearning using
performance on a task related to the unlearned information, or output similarity to that of a model
that was not trained on the information to be unlearned (Nguyen et al., 2022; Lynch et al., 2024b;
Liu et al., 2024a), but these approaches measure the propensity of the LLM to use the unlearned
knowledge, failing to capture hidden knowledge. Liu et al. (2024a) suggests two metrics to assess
unlearning effectiveness: evaluating unlearning on harder cases (e.g., jailbreaks, queries in different
languages) and Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) (Shokri et al., 2016). Since it is not possible
to try all jailbreaks, evaluating jailbreak robustness is difficult: even if some attacks fail, others may
2

succeed. For example, Li et al. (2024a) demonstrates that RMU (Li et al., 2024b) could be jailbroken
using hand-crafted attacks, despite its high robustness against many automated attacks. MIA do
not measure the absence of knowledge about a particular fact, but the likelihood that a particular
datapoint is absent from the training corpus, which is not the relevant metric for the purpose of
preventing LLM misuse.

White-box unlearning evaluations
Past work has introduced white-box unlearning evaluations
like linear probes and relearning time. Some of the white-box appraoches include linear probes and
relearning with fine-tuning. Linear Probes may recover the information present in the activations
(Lynch et al., 2024b), but are not powerful enough to detect information present in the weights.
For example, probes on top of RMU models fail to get high accuracy, but RMU models can still
be jailbroken. Relearning time and limited-sample relearning is a promising approach to evaluate
unlearning that was used by Golatkar et al. (2020a), Golatkar et al. (2020b), Tarun et al. (2023), and
Lynch et al. (2024b). Relearning time measures the number of fine-tuning steps needed to recover
accuracy on the unlearned knowledge, and limited-sample relearning fine-tunes on a limited number
of samples, where the fine-tuning data is drawn from the dataset we perform unlearning on. If accu-
racy is recovered after a small number of fine-tuning steps or with a limited number of samples, this
is evidence that the unlearning technique is ineffective at removing knowledge. The main problem
with this approach is the lack of a reliable baseline for comparison. if the information is recovered
after a specific number of fine-tuning steps or with a specific number of training samples, we cannot

determine if this number of time steps or samples implies that the information was hidden or re-
moved. This method also suffers against methods that specifically target making fine-tuning slower
or more difficult (Henderson et al., 2023; Rosati et al., 2024; Tamirisa et al., 2024a). Table 1 shows
previous approaches and how our approach compares. We expect the results from other fine-tuning-
based approaches that test for the existence of hidden knowledge to be highly correlated with ours,
but expect our approach to have an advantage. Specifically, given the design of our dataset where the
facts are independent, we can perform a larger-scale retraining/fine-tuning. This is more challenging
in other approaches, as they use facts from the same dataset, which means they either fine-tune on
a small number of facts to ensure no leakage happens, or they use more facts, which risks leakage
happening.
Weaknesses of current unlearning techniques
Previous work has shown evidence about current
unlearning techniques being weak against attacks that would fail if the information was removed
(Lynch et al., 2024a; Łucki et al., 2024; Hong et al., 2024). Our results further confirm the find-
ings of this previous work. Further, negative results using our method provide strong evidence of
unsuccessful knowledge removal relative to previous prompting-based methods.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
3.1
UNLEARNING AS REMOVING INFORMATION FROM THE WEIGHTS
While unlearning is used in previous work to imply both removing information and making it harder
to access, removing information is a stronger guarantee, as making information harder to access is
vulnerable to attacks that make the information easily accessible again like jailbreaking and fine-
tuning (Li et al., 2024a). We aim to measure how much an unlearning technique removes target
information from the weights.
More precisely, for an unlearning technique that removes information about a certain question q,
if the answer to the question was different, the weights after unlearning should not be predictably
different; they can be different due to the stochasticity of the training process, but not due to the
answer changing. For example, if we consider the question ”was the World Health Organization
(WHO) founded in 1948 or 1949?”, if the correct answer to the question was the counter-factual
1949 (the correct answer is 1948), the weights should not be different. Formally, if Y is the random
variable corresponding to the answer to q (a binary random variable in our WHO example), and θ is
the model weights after the initial training process (θ is a random variable since it depends on Y ),
then an unlearning process U fully removes the information about q from the weights if and only if
the mutual information between U(θ) and Y is 0: I(U(θ), Y ) = 0.
Facts can often be guessed based on more general information (e.g., knowing what the WHO is and
having a basic intuition about historical dates rules out the WHO being created a million years ago).
Our formalization only applies to questions that are practically impossible to guess (e.g., whether
the WHO was founded in 1948 or 1949).
3.2
ESTIMATING THE PRESENCE OF INFORMATION
We introduce a new approach based on an adversarial setup to evaluate the presence of information
in the weights. The developers of an unlearning method identify a set of independent facts the model
contains that should be removed from the model weights after unlearning, and which have negligible
mutual information given the rest of the training data (i.e. given all but one of these facts and the
rest of the training data, it is realistically infeasible to guess the remaining one without additional
information). These facts are randomly split into train and validation subsets, T and V . An attacker
then tries to recover the facts V using (1) the model weights θ and (2) the facts T. If the unlearning
process is successful, neither the model weights nor the facts T alone should enable the recovery of
V by the attacker. Any facts V that the attacker recovers indicate that these facts were hidden, rather
than removed.
Because unlearning was performed on T and V , access to T allows for the creation of attacks that
can revert the hiding behavior that some unlearning methods may lead to in the model, and because
the facts in T and V are independent, we do not need to worry about “reteaching” the model the
4

facts, which is a concern if we perform attacks that use access to V , like relearning time (see Section
2). The developers of the unlearning method try to find an unlearning technique U ∗that minimizes
the recovered accuracy on V :
U ∗= argmin
U
max
Attack E(V,T )∼splits [AccuracyV (AttackT (UT ∪V (θ)))]
That is, finding an unlearning technique that minimizes the maximum expectation of accuracy on V
after the attack on the unlearned model.
The attack we study in this work is Retraining on T (RTT) which is illustrated in Figure 1: the
attacker trains the unlearned model on the facts they have access to, T. After performing RTT,
we can use accuracy on V to approximate the mutual information introduced in section 3.1: if the
accuracy on V is high, mutual information has to be high. If the accuracy is close to random chance,
mutual information is probably low. Training on T might reveal information that was hidden by
increasing the model’s propensity to output the unlearned facts without teaching the model the facts
again. If an unlearning technique leads to information being harder to access, RTT should make
the facts T easier to access. Making the facts T easier to access can transfer to making V easier to
access since the unlearning technique was applied to both. We test how reliable this transfer is in
section 6.
As we previously mentioned, in order for the proposed metric to be a reliable measure of unlearning,
T and V should have minimal shared information; training the model on T should not increase
accuracy on V for a model that was not trained on either T or V .

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
In order to run our evaluations, we create datasets that fit our desired properties, then use them to run
unlearning and RTT. Our evaluation can also be performed on models that had already undergone
unlearning.
4.1
DATASETS
Our framework requires datasets for RTT and evaluation that ideally should have the following
properties:
1. The dataset has little shared information among facts: Learning some of the facts should
not help in learning the rest if the information is not already present in the weights.
2. Models perform well on the dataset before unlearning: This means we do not need to fine-
tune the models on the information, which may result in a different response to unlearning
compared to information learned in pretraining.
3. The data resembles what unlearning is used for in practice.
We distinguish between two types of datasets: the forget dataset and the retain dataset. The forget
dataset consists of questions that correspond to facts we want the model to unlearn. The retain
dataset consists of questions that correspond to facts that we would not want the model to unlearn;
we want the model to still know these facts after unlearning. We create several forget datasets that
vary in how well they fulfill each of the properties mentioned above and match them with appropriate
retain datasets:
• Years: A dataset of major events in the 20th century and the years they happened in. The
dataset is randomly split into 5 splits. We use 4 of them as T and 1 as V, testing multiple
times for different choices of T and V. For the retain dataset, we use Fineweb-edu (Penedo
et al., 2024).
• MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021b;a): By default, MMLU has 58 subsets. We categorize
them into 10 categories such that there’s little shared information between these categories.
We use 4 of these categories for T, 1 for V, and the other 5 as the retain dataset.
5

• WMDP-Deduped: A filtered version of WMDP (Li et al., 2024b) with lower leakage
among questions. The original dataset is not suitable for the purpose of our evaluations
since it contains skill-based questions and questions using the same pieces of information.
We compare WMDP and WMDP-Deduped in Appendix I. We split it into 5 splits, using 4
of them for T and 1 for V. For the retain dataset, we use Fineweb-edu (Penedo et al., 2024).
• Random Birthdays (fine-tuned information): A dataset with randomly generated names
and randomly generated years of birth. As it is randomly generated, we first fine-tune the
models on the dataset, unlike the other 3 datasets. We use 4 splits for T and 1 split for V. We
use a subset of the MMLU categories for the retain dataset. The creation of the Random
Birthdays dataset was inspired by Maini et al. (2024), and we use it to test unlearning
methods when we are confident that the facts are independent. We test that the facts are
indeed independent and show the results in Appendix E.
For each of these datasets, we use two formats: plain-text and multiple-choice questions (MCQ).
Because unlearning is supposed to unlearn facts and not just a specific format, we perform unlearn-
ing on a dataset using the plain text format, but RTT and evaluation using the MCQ format. The
plain-text format is generated from the MCQ using GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024), and we provide ex-
amples in Appendix K. Figure 4 shows how the format of the unlearning dataset affects unlearning
performance.
4.2
UNLEARNING
We mainly use Llama 3 (8b) (Llama Team, 2024) for our experiments, but we find similar results
with other models. We use the plain-text data format for unlearning. The main unlearning methods
we test are:
1. Gradient Difference (GD) (Liu et al., 2022): Gradient Ascent on the forget dataset and
Gradient Descent on the retain dataset. LossGD = −LossForget + α ∗LossRetain Where α is
the retain coefficient. We note that using a retain coefficient of 0 corresponds to using the
Gradient Ascent unlearning method.
2. RMU (Li et al., 2024b): An unlearning technique that perturbs the activations of the model
in a subset of the models’ layers for harmful prompts while preserving the activations for
non-harmful prompts.
3. Random Incorrect Answer (RIA): For each question with multiple choice answers, we cre-
ate a plain-text formatted datapoint for each incorrect choice and perform gradient descent
on these texts.
Unlearning is only useful when the model maintains performance on other non-unlearned tasks. We
therefore configure the unlearning strength for each unlearning method to get a balance of low forget
accuracy and high retain accuracy. For RMU, we configure the α hyperparameter as introduced by
(Li et al., 2024b), which scales the retain loss before creating the final loss. For the other unlearning
methods, we use a similar hyperparameter: a coefficient we multiply the retain loss by. We consider
the results for unlearning that lead to a drop in the retain accuracy less than or equal to 5% of the
retain accuracy of the original model in Section 5, in addition to other retain accuracy drops in
Appendix G.
4.3
RETRAINING ON T AND EVALUATION
We perform RTT using the MCQ format of the facts. We experiment with a variety of learning rates
and run RTT with two random choices evaluation split (V ). In each run, we fine-tune the model on
the other 4 remaining splits. We report the mean accuracy over the two runs and use the learning
rate with the highest validation accuracy.
Across datasets, each split across has 157 datapoints. We use 4 split for T (628 total datapoints) and
1 split for V . We use the same RTT hyperparameters for all datasets and unlearning methods. These
hyperparameters and uncertainty estimations can be found in Appendix A. We also experiment with
multiple options for the loss and discuss results in Appendix B.

such that the drop in the retain accuracy is less than or equal to 5%, where the unlearning strength
is controlled by adjusting the corresponding hyperparameter (see Section 4.2) in each unlearning
method. The results for a retain accuracy drop of less than or equal to 10%, 30% and 100% are
available in Appendix G.

RESULTS
5.1
UNLEARNING PRETRAINED INFORMATION
As shown in Figure 2, we find that both RMU and GD successfully reduce the accuracy after per-
forming unlearning. RIA leads to less significant reductions in accuracy. For all methods, RTT
recovers the forget accuracy close to its original level for pretrained information (Years, MMLU,
and WMDP-Deduped datasets), which suggests that most of the information was hidden, not re-
moved from the weights.
To quantify the quality of an unlearning technique in removing information, we consider Recovery
Rate: the ratio of accuracy on V of the unlearned model after RTT to the accuracy on V of the
original model after RTT:
Recovery Rate = Accuracy on V of the unlearned model after RTT
Accuracy on V of the original model after RTT
A lower recovery rate corresponds to more successful information removal. In our tests, recovery
rates for pretrained information were greater than 88%, implying poor performance at removing
information.
To test whether the retain loss is restricting unlearning methods from appropriately removing the
information from the weights, we run unlearning with different unlearning strengths to achieve dif-
ferent values for the retain accuracy. Figure 3 shows that even with large losses in the retain accuracy,
RTT is able to recover accuracy on the forget dataset with pretrained information. Even if we do not
include a retain loss, RTT is often able to recover forget accuracy (see Appendix G, Figure 10). RTT

Figure 3: The tradeoff between the forget accuracy and the retain accuracy on the Years dataset when
using RMU for values of retain coefficient α between 0 and 103 (smaller retain coefficient leads to
stronger unlearning). When increasing the unlearning strength, the forget accuracy decreases before
the retain accuracy drops too much, but when choosing an unlearning strength so high that the retain
accuracy drops to 25%, the forget accuracy after RTT remains high.
recovering accuracy even when the model is not incentivized to retain performance on other tasks
implies that the unlearning methods are not restricted by having to maintain good performance on
the retain dataset.
5.2
UNLEARNING FINE-TUNED INFORMATION
RTT does not recover information for the fine-tuned dataset (Random Birthdays); we still get a high
recovery rate for RMU, but a recovery rate less than 35% for GD and RIA. We suspect that changes
introduced by fine-tuning might be relatively superficial and easy to reverse as observed by Jain et al.
(2024). However, we only experiment with one dataset with fine-tuned information and leave it to
future work to determine how easy it is to robustly remove information learned by fine-tuning.
5.3
FORMAT OF UNLEARNING DATASETS
We test how the format of text used for unlearning affects performance. The results are shown
in Figure 4. Using the plain-text generated by GPT-4o (examples can be found in Appendix K)
provides the best balance of performance across different unlearning methods, in addition to being
generalizable to all MCQ datasets. RMU performs better than GD when the unlearning dataset is
related but does not necessarily contain the same facts as the ones used in RTT and evaluation. GD
performs best when all of the unlearning dataset, RTT and evaluation use the MCQ format and the
loss is restricted to the answer tokens. These observations may imply that RMU tends to generalize
the unlearning more than GD does.

STRESS-TESTING RETRAINING ON T
6.1
HIGH GRANULARITY KNOWLEDGE HIDING
When models hide facts, they can hide them at multiple levels of granularity. For example, in the
case of the random birthday dataset, the model could learn to (a) hide information about all birthdays
(low granularity) or (b) only hide the information about the birthdays of specific individuals but not
others (high granularity). RTT is meant to remove the general propensity to hide facts, so RTT might
succeed only when the information is hidden at a low level of granularity. To stress-test RTT in a
high-granularity setting, we create a model that hides knowledge at a high level of granularity.

tokens.)

We use the Random Birthdays dataset, which we generate using a random name generator and
randomly generated dates of birth. To ensure that the knowledge is still in the weights and that it
is hidden, we use the approach illustrated in Figure 5: we fine-tune the model on the dataset while
freezing the second half of the layers until we reach an accuracy of 98%, and then unfreeze the
second half of the layers and freeze the first half of the layers and perform unlearning. To push the
hiding strategy to have high granularity, we use a retain dataset from the same distribution as the
forget dataset: randomly generated birth dates for randomly generated names. This means the model
should learn to hide information about the birthdays in the forget dataset while keeping information
about the other birthdays in the retain dataset drawn from the same distribution, which should push
the model to create a high-granularity hiding strategy.
We perform unlearning using GD with multiple hyperparameters and loss types. We discuss the
hyperparameters and additional details in Appendix H. With the hyperparameters that obtain the
best trade-off, we were able to obtain 35% forget accuracy and 82% retain accuracy. We then
perform RTT on the model to see if we can recover the lost accuracy. We were able to recover the
forget accuracy back to 83% quickly.
Our results suggests that RTT can recover hidden knowledge even with high-granularity knowledge
hiding, though it is unclear how well these results transfer to more natural examples of hidden
knowledge.
6.2
RETRAINING ON T VS TECHNIQUES TO SLOW DOWN FINE-TUNING
There are techniques that directly target making fine-tuning models on specific information difficult
(Rosati et al., 2024; Henderson et al., 2023). We test RTT against one of these techniques and find
that it can successfully recover information. More information can be found in Appendix C.
7
DISCUSSION
7.1
LIMITATIONS
RTT is expensive
Relative to simple accuracy evaluation on a benchmark, our approach requires
fine-tuning with hyperparameter search which is more expensive. Looking for methods other than
RTT to recover unlearned information requires even more effort.
RTT does not ensure information is removed
Our evaluation does not guarantee that informa-
tion is removed from the weights; rather, it sets a higher bar than previous evaluation methods for
unlearning. For example, if an unlearning technique leads to hiding information such that the hiding
of each fact happens in a separate part of the model (e.g., different layers), we expect that RTT may
not recover accuracy on V even though the information is still present in the weights. Still, it works
well for current unlearning methods (as we show in Appendix C).
Low-leakage datasets are hard to build
Our evaluation only works on a set of facts that have
low leakage. Such property may not be available depending on the goal of the unlearning. This also
means that our evaluation does not cover evaluating unlearning capabilities. For example, if the goal
is to unlearn the capability of coding, it’s hard to construct T and V with low leakage.
Removing information is a property stronger than strictly required
Ensuring safety may only
require making information hard enough to access. For example, jailbreak robustness could in prin-
ciple be achieved without removing information from model weights, but jailbreak robustness is
hard to assess directly, resulting in overestimates of jailbreak robustness (Li et al., 2024a). The alter-
native we suggest likely provides better safety guarantees, but future work may find less conservative
targets that provide strong enough guarantees.
7.2
RECOMMENDATIONS
In the light of our work and inspired by Carlini et al. (2019a), we make the following recommen-
dations for future research on addressing dangerous capabilities and knowledge of Artificial Intelli-
gence models:
10

1. Indicate whether the purpose of the proposed method is to remove inforLmation or make
the information harder to access in the model.
2. When the goal is removing capabilities and/or knowledge, evaluate the proposed method
against attacks that aim to recover them, like using the RTT attack presented in this paper.
Additionally, we recommend testing against information learned during pretraining, as in-
formation learned by fine-tuning might not transfer to realistic settings; our evaluations on
the Random Birthdays dataset overestimate the robustness of some unlearning techniques
compared to datasets containing pretrained information.
3. Release the models the proposed method was applied to and the code base used to apply
the method to facilitate evaluating the robustness of the method by other researchers.
8
CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose focusing on developing unlearning methods that target removing informa-
tion from models over making information harder to access. To help in distinguishing between the
two cases, we propose RTT as a method for evaluating the effectiveness of an unlearning technique
for removing information and test some notable unlearning methods against our evaluation. The
tested unlearning methods remove a small ratio of information in our experiments, especially when
these methods maintain good retain accuracy. We end with recommendations for future work on
addressing dangerous knowledge and capabilities in models.

for T and V and report that as Number of iterations. Regarding epochs, we run RTT for 6 epochs,
record accuracies after each epoch and report the maximum across the 6 epochs.
Using the number of evaluation datapoints (157 datapoints in V ), we can calculate an upper bound
for uncertainty.

We multiply the number of datapoints by 2 as we run RTT twice for different choices of T and V .
B
RTT LOSS
We experiment with different loss types for RTT to see which is the best at recovering hidden knowl-
edge. We distinguish between two cases:
1. Multiple choice questions with the choices preceded by letters (A, B, C, D). We test the
following variations:
(a) Letter Loss: We take the loss only on the letter representing the answer.
(b) Letter-Answer Loss: We take the loss on the letter followed by the answer.
(c) Question-Letter-Answer Loss: We take the loss on the question, the letter, and the
answer.
2. Plain-Text: We take the loss on plain text that has a different formatting than the one used
for unlearning.
We run RTT using these loss types on multiple unlearning methods and multiple datasets. We find
that RTT with the MCQ Question-Letter-Answer loss performed best at recovering hidden informa-
tion.
C
FINE-TUNING ROBUST METHODS
Given that RTT relies on fine-tuning the model, we look for unlearning methods that directly target
robustness to fine-tuning to test the reliability of our framework. We test our framework on RepNoise
introduced by Rosati et al. (2024), which targets adding noise to the harmful representations in the
layers of the LLM. We perform RTT on a model that was provided by the authors with an extensive
list of learning rates and epochs as seen in Figure 6. We split the dataset on which they performed
RepNoise into subsets that had low leakage. We do a more extensive hyperparameter search for RTT
relative to other methods, but as we can see in Figure 6, we are able to recover accuracy as good as
the one we get by fine-tuning the original model.
Other techniques include Tampering Attack Resistance (TAR) introduced by Tamirisa et al. (2024a),
but this technique is vulnerable against parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) as demenstorated in
the work.
15

Figure 6: Comparison of accuracies after retraining on T with (right) and without (left) RepNoise
for different hyper-parameters.
Overall, because fine-tuning robustness techniques can be bypassed when using an extensive hyper-
parameter search, we think using RTT with an extensive hyperparameter search would still expose
knowledge that was not removed.
D
LOSS ON RELEVANT TOKENS ONLY
When performing unlearning on a set of tokens in the plain-text format, it may confuse the model
to unlearn some irrelevant tokens. For example, if we train the model on “The WHO was founded
in 1949” which has the incorrect year, we only care about the year tokens as they contain the infor-
mation about when the WHO was founded. We wanted to test if unlearning methods would perform
better with this approach. We performed unlearning using GD and RIA taking the loss only on the
year, but found that it made no significant difference compared to using the loss on all tokens.
E
MUTUAL INFORMATION IN RANDOM BIRTHDAYS DATASET
We use the random birthdays dataset to ensure it has minimal shared information, such that we have
one dataset we are sure has little shared information. To test this assumption, we perform RTT
on an original model that has not been fine-tuned on the random birthdays dataset. The highest
accuracy we are able to get is 31.2%. This implies that the random birthdays dataset indeed has
little shared information and performing RTT does not increase the accuracy on V for a model that
has no knowledge of either.
F
PROVIDED RMU MODEL
In order to confirm our evaluation of RMU, we performed RTT on the zephyr-7b-beta with RMU
provided by Li et al. (2024b). The results can be seen in Figure 7. We find that RTT was able to
recover most of the lost accuracy.
G
RESULTS FOR DIFFERENT DROPS IN RETAIN ACCURACIES
Figure 2 shows the accuracies after unlearning and after RTT such that the drop in the retain accuracy
is less than or equal to 5%. We show the results for different drops in retain accuracies in figures 8,
9, and 10.

STRESS-TESTING DETAILS
When performing the stress-test described in section 6, we first fine-tune the original model on the
Random Birthdays dataset while freezing the second half of the model. We then perform unlearning
using GD while freezing the first half of the model. Performing this unlearning required an ex-
tensive hyperparameter search and multiple trials with the final hyperparameter configuration to get
unlearning to wor. In runs where unlearning succeeds, we use the Lion optimizer (Chen et al., 2023),
a 6.4e-6 learning rate, 11 epochs, and a retain coefficient of 1. In addition, we restrict the loss to
be on the number tokens, to help the model focus on the tokens that contain information that should
be unlearned. While unlearing took many trials to succeed, RTT recovers information successfully
without multiple trials.
I
WMDP VS WMDP-DEDUPED
We create WMDP-Deduped to create a version of WMDP that has low shared information among
facts. We do this by removing skill-based questions (which use the same templates and rely on
similar facts) using keyword matching (e.g. ”What is the output”), and removing duplicate questions
using the cosine similarity of questions and answers separately, using OpenAI’s text-embedding-3-
large. We use an aggressive threshold of 0.7 for WMDP-cyber and 0.6 for WMDP-bio. We manually
check that pairs of questions just below these thresholds do not seem to be about the same facts.
We do not include any of the 408 questions from WMDP-chem both for simplicity and because the
original WMDP paper focuses on unlearning in cybersecurity and biosecurity but not in chemistry.
Because our filtering process is very aggressive, the resulting dataset only has 785 questions (against
3260 for WMDP-cyber/bio). Most excluded questions are false-positive of our filtering process.
We compare examples from WMDP and WMDP-Deduped in Table 3.

D. Almost zero.
Answer: C. High.
In
the
context
of
a
dynamometer
wattmeter, the resistance in the circuit
of the moving coil should be high.
In a dynamometer wattmeter, the circuit
containing the moving coil needs to have
a high resistance.

Question: What are the downsides of
using Metasploit for performing an attack?
Choices: A. Publicly Accessible
Framework. B. Limited Exploit Options.
C. High Detection Rate. D.
Incompatibility with Windows Systems.
Answer: C. High Detection Rate.
Using Metasploit for performing an at-
tack has its downsides, one of which is its
high detection rate.
This means that se-
curity systems and antivirus software are
more likely to identify and block the attack,
making it less effective for covert opera-
tions.
Using Metasploit to carry out an attack
comes with certain drawbacks, notably its
high likelihood of being detected. This el-
evated detection rate means that security
systems and antivirus programs are more
prone to identifying and thwarting the at-
tack, reducing its effectiveness for stealthy
activities.
When utilizing Metasploit to conduct an
attack, one notable drawback is its signifi-
cant detection rate. This implies that secu-
rity measures and antivirus tools are more
adept at recognizing and preventing the at-
tack, thereby diminishing its efficacy for
clandestine operations.

HISTORICAL NOTE
In an earlier version of this preprint, we used a version of the Random Birthdays that had a few
duplicate names; the same name appeared more than once with different birthdays. This was not
our intention. When using this old version, we were able to recover the information after unlearning
using RTT.
Thanks to an ICLR reviewer who asked about name duplicates, we noticed the issue and fixed it.
The current version of the Random Birthdays dataset has no duplicates. Removing duplicates and
replacing them with other unique name-birthday pairs changed the results, and RTT cannot recover
most information after unlearning with GD and RIA.
