1. indicate whether the purpose of the proposed method is to remove information or make the information harder to access in the model. 2. when the goal is removing capabilities and/or knowledge, evaluate the proposed method against attacks that aim to recover them, like using the rtt attack presented in this paper. additionally, we recommend testing against information learned during pretraining, as information learned by finetuning might not transfer to realistic settings; our evaluations on the random birthdays dataset overestimate the robustness of some unlearning techniques compared to datasets containing pretrained information. 3. release the models the proposed method was applied to and the code base used to apply the method to facilitate evaluating the robustness of the method by other researchers.
